The meat here is horrible and the horchata is nasty taste like dirty sink water. I do not recommend this Filibertos.,,,,
The best And most authentic Udipi restaurant I haven been to. Authentic light good portions and lightly priced. Amazing. A must stop for anyone driving past especially on the highway.,,,Value,
Food tasted great but one of the pieces of chicken had a bite taken out of it so... 4 stars,,,,
Great prices and good selection of flavors. Thisnis a good local ice cream place tontake the kids or grab a quick treat.,Service,,Value,
Was in Litchfield Park for a conference and found this gem of a restaurant after stopping by Walgreens across the street. Definitely good value for the money and fast service too. I tried the spicy tuna bowl and a side of a cucumber roll. Way better than any other fast food restaurant food. I only wish they would come to LA (along with Culvers),Service,,Value,
Had a limited availability item a Wagyu cut. Perfection in any sense. Service was excellent. Sides of garlic mashed garlic Mac and cheese and creamed corn where great. Topped it off with a Jack Daniels Single Barrel.,Service,,,
An awesome store to check out if you are in the Downtown location. The store perfectly embodies the old fashion candy store vibe they are trying to convey and the selection of candies and sodas is incredible unique. Some of the candies they have there are things that I have certainly forgotten about over the years and some of the soda flavors are things I would never even think to see!,,Ambience,,Location
Love the ice cream. And the cookie ice cream sandwiches are so good! I love that the cookies are still soft! Always had great service as well.,Service,,,
Fresh homemade food and friendly service! The green chile quiche was tasty and had a punch of heat to it! The side of Greek salad was also fresh and tasty! I plan to return!,Service,,,
Great little spot. As far as fast food burritos go this place is pretty danm good. Its no chipotle but i always feel that i have received good value for my money.\n\nThe ingredients are fresh and their service is quick.,Service,,Value,
Nice clean restaurant very compact need to wait if you come at the peak hour. Food is tasty but not too much special.,,,,
IMO probably the best BBQ pork in Toronto! I work in the building and love going there for lunch to get BBQ pork on rice (comes with some Bok Choy too) for about $6. U also have option to get it with noodles and soup instead of rice.,,,Value,
I got a large take out order for a party and the food as well as the service was very good. Prices are ok too.,Service,,Value,
I went here with my girl who wanted Italian. The ambience was good until the meal came. We both ordered fish dishes. Hers was the Sea Bass was ok until a few bites in and it was raw. Then loud rock music blaring from the kitchen. I like this music but not when I wanted a nice romantic dinner. I was then over charged by almost 100.00 with no corrected receipt just a name and a promise. I hope my money has been returned. We will never go back to this sketchy so called Italian restaurant.!!,,Ambience,,
A food burger is always a good thing!!! Great flavor & fast service. \n\nDrinks: no issues.\nFood: fast and served hot\nService: it was busy but our server always checked on us.,Service,,,
Super good service. Fresh salad. Broccolini was cooked perfectly. I ordered iced tea and they had simple syrup.,Service,,,
It was a nice summer evening when we dined at this place. This restaurant is in a interesting locale. Perfect place to sit outside and watch the pedestrian traffic in the distillery district. \nAs for the food nothing to write home about.\nBouillabaisse was very bland and tasted more like a cold fish broth. \nWe ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and were quite disappointed. \nBread was good and the Oysters were the only saving grace for the meal.,,Ambience,,Location
This place needs help!! 25 mins for an appetizer that never came because we had to leave.. its 90* and no ac ..menu was way to hard to figure out.. after 5 mins with waitress who seemed just as confussed.. waited so long for our order that we wrote it down ..,Service,,,
I have had butter chicken vegetable biriyani and chaana masala. The food is delicious and flavourful here. I have ordered many times here and it has always been good. I highly recommend this place.,,,,
Really enjoyed my scramble buckwheat crepe and pancake. Had to persevere to get a table around 2 on a Saturday as the host initially turned away my friend but it was worth it. Service was solid until the end when a busser tossed the rest of my friends bowl which he intended to take away but maybe he should have been more clear. All in all a good experience.,Service,,,
Best Pud Thai I have had in Charlotte!! So delicious I cannot stand when my Pud Thai is overly sweet and peanutty if you like that kind of Pud Thai this one is not for you. It was absolutely delicious and the perfect balance of sweet and tangy.,,,,
Got some gift cards from a friend first time at an outback had the porterhouse and filet and lobster tail lobster tail was the highlight steaks were pretty decent the filet was over cooked porterhouse was on point our food was really good just nothing extra ordinary would return if I get some more gift cards,,,,
We stopped in at General Assembly because it was across the street from our hotel but we are glad we gave it a try. The decor is hip and the menu plays to foodies and people who eat clean.\n\nThey offer a variety of pizzas that are the perfect size for one or enough for two if you each order salads. We split the mushroom pizza and I had the kale salad while my fianc\xc3\xa9 had the arugula apple salad. We enjoyed all of it. General Assembly also had a wide selection of beers sodas and wines.,,Ambience,,
Please check out Youtube video for prices and choices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JLeIAGnpXA\nThere is always line up and it took me 20 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. But the ice cream and egg waffle really taste good and i love the flavours that they have.,,,,
Still great homemade Thai food after the years I have been coming here. Best pad si ew with chicken and pad ki mao with fried tofu. Well worth a visit if you have never been. Enjoy drooling over the pics :-),,,,
A hidden gem in North Town! Love the hand made tacos. Carne fries are a MUST! Great prices!,,,Value,
Great food! I love all the veggies in the food especially the fried rice! Always fast delivery and reasonable prices. This is our go to Chinese food restaurant.,Service,,Value,

Waited an hour and a half for our main.\nDont dont go here for winterlicious\nHorrible experience,Service,,,
You started off so well....\nI thought we could start a relationship out of this but I guess not.\nWeb ordering my marketplace turkey sandwich I clearly asked for no tomatoes. The girl behind the intercom even repeated this back to me. But of course what happens? I get my sandwich and on it are three red tomatoes slices.\nI know I sound like a brat. I simply took the tomatoes off but its the principle and quite simple to follow.,Service,,,
One of 3 Cherry Berry locations I have been to in the Charlotte Area. The place server the same great yogurt that the other locations do but it just has the smallest selection at 10 as the other locations have 12 or 14 individual selections. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good cheap dessert.,,,Value,
At the encouragement of the management we gave Red Robin another try. Much better this time. It was a busy Sunday afternoon so it took quite a while for our order. But when it came the food was hot and tasty. And our server was really great at keeping u updated on the status of the order. Overall wife and I had a good experience. Glad we gave it another shot.,Service,,,
If you have a craving for fish and chips this is the go-to place. The fish is freshly battered and fried on order. We had the halibut and chips... the flavor and freshness were excellent. The chips are freshly cut and fried on premises. Unbeatable flavor. Give it a try!!!!,,,,
Today we tried this location for the first time. We ordered two of the fajitas for two. My husband and I shared one n my kids shared the other. It was way more food than we could eat. Very pleased with the portions of food for our money. The food was delicious. The service was great. This will be our new go to for Mexican food close to home. We will definitely be coming back. Thank you for a great lunch and a great dining experience. Thumbs up!,Service,Ambience,Value,
excellent prices food and service. I have both ordered delivery and pick up both were satisfyingly swift and successful. I will definitely continue to order personally as well as refer to all of my friends,Service,,Value,
Pretentious coffee without the pretense. This place has all the artisanal coffee offerings of a hipster cafe but the chill attitude of a starbucks. Appreciate being able to walk in and get a good of joe without feeling judged for taking a minute to look at the menu.,,Ambience,,
Awesome! Stopped in based on reviews and was not disappointed.\nThe street tacos were great; my husband had the El Jefe burrito - all freshly prepared and delicious. The perfect ending was the made to order Churros!,,,,
Nice interiorbut the food is really not authenticand the food quality is not steady alsowill come back for drinks but not food,,Ambience,,
Great little restaurant with family style mexican food. Their chips and salsa are always good and they are quick to refill it. The service is great but gets a little hectic around normal lunch hours M-F so I try to go earlier or later.\n\nI recommend their chimichanga and their carnitas plate. Very good portions too enough where you can probably share.\n\nI think the food is way better here than overpriced places like Agave.,Service,,Value,
Food was way over cooked and quite bland. The white pizza we ordered might as well have been cardboard.,,,,
This place is amazing! We had a little surprise party of 8 and had just the best service! The queso appetizer fontina and bottomless rice and beans for the table was a hit! These puffy tacos were amazing both the chicken tinga and the spicy beef. \nThe lomo sampler platter was amazing too great flavors! For preggo moms ask for their agua fresca delish!,Service,,,
By far the best fro-yo in the valley...maybe ever All of the flavors are made in-house and the difference is amazing! The staff is very friendly and down to earth. Always a must go when family and friends visit from out of town!,Service,,,
Just went to this small restaurant for the first time today It will certainly not be my last visit I may adjust star rating after further trips. The food was excellent as was the portion size. Very attentive staff. A large selection of Asian beers with more to follow I am told.\nPricing was fair. If you like Asian food and curry you will not be disappointed.,Service,,Value,
"My girlfriend and I ate here today for lunch. We didn\'t know it was a ""cash"" only establishment but the guy who waited on us was very nice. He took our order and by the time we got back from Giant Eagle with cash our subs were done. They were very good and the price was great for the amount of food. I had the Italian sub and my girlfriend had the Philly cheese steak. I loved the sub rolls and the fries were delicious. I would definitely come back and try a new sub!",Service,,,
Been coming here for years. Love the food relaxed and enjoyable environment. Great local place to chill and unwind.,,Ambience,,
This place is great and not too expensive. Las Vegas rolls are awesome. Had to grab a couple to go on the way home tonight.,,,Value,
Overall very good food and service. Some of the dishes were a bit Asian tasting (chili paneer and ginger chicken) but food was fresh tasty and came out quick on a busy night. \nDefinitely a keeper for that area.,Service,,,
I was here at lunch time on a weekday. I was the only customer in the store and I had made it clear I was in a hurry. Despite this the man making the food moved extremely slowly and took more than 15 minutes to make my food. He would pause at times to argue with his co-worker. It was a very frustrating experience.,Service,,,
The restaurant is cute and the menu is original. The place was really busy but the service was quick short food wait time and the service was friendly. Expect it to be loud since a lot of people enjoy eating there as much as we did. Great place to visit for yummy breakfast!,Service,Ambience,,
"Ate here 2 times on my recent trip to LV.\n\nChicken sandwich on a yummy bun and french fries....YUM!\nService was good colleague got the onion rings (YUMMY).\n\nWent back another night to order food to go-\nSwiss cheeseburger on an onion roll (wow it was good)\nFrench fries (crispy and delicous).\n\nWhile I was waiting I had a most delicious drink ""French Riviera"". It was yummy! So I had another. Very nice!",,,,
A place i like to take the kids if we need to satisfy our sweet tooth without feeling too guilty. Just went recently and they have changed up the flavors which i was excited for. Inside you can also get fudge and chocolate from the rocky Mountain chocolate company.,,,,
I have had ramen before. Never ever has it impressed me like the ramen I ate at Kyouka Ramen. I totally understand why tv chefs pursue the ultimate ramen experience. Kyouka has taken ramen to a level I never have experienced. Recommend the Kyouka Ramen (spicy).,,,,
BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE!! They have a greater variety of proteins. They have local brews. They have King of Pops. And they have delicious queso!,,,,
Beautiful Christmas lunch. The hostesses were not pleasant bit the waiters and servers for the brunch were excellent! ! So helpful and quick. The valet people were great too! We ate indoors which was nice but the tables were too close to each other. Food was tasty! They had a nice variety traditional turkey dinner sushi pasta seafood and a fantastic dessert bar!,Service,Ambience,,
Saw they had a better YELP rating than Don Tortaco so I came to check them out. Unfortunately they were closed an hour and half early. Went to Don Tortaco across the street.,,,,
Holy crap. that was good!!!!!!!\nmarshmallow in the bottom of the cone. fantastic. \nbare bones operation but who needs flair for icecream.,,,,
Great food. Good service for lunch on a Saturday. Had the chicken sandwich and it was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend!,Service,,,
"Horrible pizza! I ordered pizza for my staff and when the food finally came we had to go out and get it because the driver didn\'t ""know where we were"" nor did she even attempt to ask us where the closest entrance was. The pizza looked as bad as it tasted. It appeared to have been sitting out for a long time before it was delivered. I will not be ordering from here ever again!",Service,,,
A relaxing place to spend time with friends or family. These fondue places are great in that you can slow down and spend time conversing and really enjoy a meal. Its also bring your own wine or beer.,,Ambience,,
This subway is way better than the one in huntersville and in davidson! It is always clean staff is friendly and I never have any problems with anything. Everyone who works here (for the most part) are friendly. And the product is always fresh. \n\nI find this location worth the extra 10 minute drive over going to the huntersville/davidson subways,Service,Ambience,,
love their drinks and they have good food. the staff is friendly and take out is prepared correctly and quickly. Costco has gift cards that cost less than the face value so you can really get more bang for your buck!,Service,,Value,
So I ordered my eggs sunnyside up and wife orders over medium and we had to switch plates.... my sunnyside up was more done than her over medium. Food was like warm at best. Ordered pancakes and French toast and had to wait on server to ask if everything was ok before we could get syrup..... probably not a repeater.....,Service,,,
Gave it four stars last time. Food and service has gone down hill since then. The specials are absolutely atrocious and old standbys we used to like are lower quality. Skip this place.,Service,,,
Waited 20 minutes for a pizza that looked like it was out of a box. From the clearance bin. At a bottom of the line grocery store. That cost $17 for a large pepperoni. Will never go back,,,Value,
"Very inefficient means of service - an ""assembly line"" type of structure might work a lot better for this place. Instead there are three separate lines for three different types of meat and the lines for asada and al pastor are significantly longer. By the time we sat down with our tacos they were cold (because the line to pay is even longer and there is only one cashier). Not sure if it\'s just this location but my party was disappointed to say the least.",Service,,,
Went here since it was close and it was definitely a good decision. Customer service is excellent and the yelp special was amazing. It was cheesy and had enough meat for a meat lover like myself. The place is very comfortable and more people should definitely go here. No wait time at all.,Service,,Value,
Excellent pork tenderloin served over broken rice. The egg rolls are some of the better ones in town very unique. Definitely coming back to try the pho,,,,
Food is ok. Service was poop. Called in to go order at 11:55am. They said 20 min. Arrived at 12:20pm. Actually received food at 12:57pm. Lunch hour burned waiting. YMMV.,Service,,,
THE. BEST. PIZZA. EVER. I do wish the wings were bigger it seems like they have gotten smaller. ALWAYS my favorite place to go for pizza and wings though.,,,Value,
The Foie Gras starter was the best I have ever had. Absolutely glorious.\n\nI had the lamb as a main and was a bit disappointed. The sauce tasted like a good base sauce with a sprinkle too much curry powder (of all things) which had not had time to properly cook in. \n\nService was excellent. I would go back to give them a second chance for sure.,Service,,Value,
This is the best Thai in the city without a doubt. Just amazing flavors and extremely friendly staff. Definitely order a Thai ice tea.,Service,,,
Had a quick lunch with hubby on good Friday. Service was good we both got lunch combos and food came out fast. The miso soup was piping hot which is nice. I got the sushi and teriyaki combo it came with 2 gyoza salad 2 shrimp tempura 3 California rolls 4 nigiris and teriyaki chicken on rice along with the miso soup. It was very filling for $15.50. A good place in the neighborhood to get sushi.,Service,,Value,
Half the desserts were gone there was no cotton candy for the kids and only got one refill on the drinks.,Service,,Value,
Cold beer and amazing green beans - shiitake mushrooms\nAnd the full French name to boot! Good people watching when you are spending some time in PHX!,,,,

Just moved to the area and have been looking for good Pho and I found it! Very flavorful and fresh. And my picky husband has never tried Vietnamese food and loved the #28. Broken rice and BBQ pork chop. Delicious and affordable! My new favor spot!!,,,Value,
Favorite in Tempe. Much better a little farther from ASU. Love the family that owns it. Good times.,,,,
The tortillas are the best in town. They are think though so you may want to ask for a double wrapped or use a knife and fork. This location certainely is in a sketch area but trust me this does not deter people from coming and at luch time it is packed. My suggestion is to try the oaxaca buriito!,,,,Location

Amazing food and fantastic service. They go above and beyond to make customers happy. The price is very reasonable and it is such a fun treat for the kids. I love that you can put feta and sun dried tomatoes on the pizza! So yummy. My favorite.,Service,,Value,
Came here with a couple of people and ordered enough for five. We got a neat sashimi platter that came on a lazy susan for maximum reachability. We also had an order of the tempura. It was all very very good and the sashimi was very fresh. The service was great. Will return!,Service,,Value,

"12:15 PM (Friday) arrived at the restaurant.\n12:20 placed our order.\n12:35 we had to ask for the complimentary chips. 12:50 Megan our server stopped by the table to see if we ""needed anything"". Uh yes our food please. \n1:10 after witnessing tables that were seated after us get served we asked to have our food boxed to go as we had to return to work. \n1:30 opened the take out boxes of food and found the most bland American-Mexican food we had ever had. \nWill not be returning.",Service,,,

My all time favorite Pizza. Yes it is a little pricey but trust me you are getting nothing but the freshest ingrediants. My husband I have been going to Romeos ever since it was a small little pizza place across from the gas station and now it has grown. We have tried the other Romeos the one in columbus wadsworth and lodi. It doesnt matter which one you go to its same good pizza. Ubu,,,Value,
Pizza bread sticks and mozzarella cheese sticks were fantastic. The only reason i didnt give it 5 star is because the drinks are priced high $4+.,,,Value,
I really love this place been going here for 20 years. I love their food only gripe is over the Potatoes they put in the ground Beef. Besides that every thing else is Great.,,,,
LOVE Rubios. Food here is always great and salsa is fresh!,,,,
A couple girls from work get takeout from Los Favoritos multiple times a week. I was invited in on one of their lunches one Saturday and have been hooked since. Everyone is always very friendly and the food is always delicious. Keep it up!,Service,,,
All three of our meals were very good. Chicken Salmon and stake. Very satisfied. I would recommend fishers tavern to anyone looking for a nice meal. The staff was friendly and the service was quite satisfactory.,Service,,,
Oh my God! The burger was juicy it was good. The fries were equally as good. I loved it so much!! The guys behind the counter are super helpfull I see myself going back.,Service,,,
No flavors in meat they even managed to screw the baklava. Two stars only for the quantity.,,,Value,
We ate here as we were staying in the Elara which was connected to the miracle mile shops and Planet Hollywood. The service was on point but you could tell they definitely are trained to up-sell drinks and side items. Their food was excellent and this was probably the best burger I have ever had/will have in a while. I definitely recommend this restaurant should you be in Las Vegas!,,,,
I really love the El Mirage location of Rio Mirage. The food tastes great the service is awesome the atmosphere is nice and the Monday margarita deals are phenomenal! I will mention the Surprise location does not earn the same rating but the El Mirage location is the best Mexican around!,Service,Ambience,Value,
Expected to have a great experience based on reviews. The rotating food was either old or was the same. Try to order and was rudely told to wait then I was totally ignored by the waiting staff. So I went to RA. Was totally worth the extra few pennies and the service is amazing.,Service,,,
The food was good... we had a mix up on our food the manager came over and said he would fix it. He did and was super respectful.\n\nGood service and good food,Service,,,

First time ordering at lunch. Had delivered through PostMates luch was here quickly and hot! I had the one meat combo with brisket. Super tender and flavorful mac and cheese needed a little salt and the beans were amazing! I will order again.,,,,
I have been eating at the BD for about a year 4-5 times a week. Everything I have had is really good. I was especially impressed with the corned beef sandwich piled high like in NYC. I love the chicken salad sandwich meatball sandwich and hot sausage sandwich (although not spicy but still good). During the week at lunch time there is a line about 15 deep but you get your food pretty quick. Their bread is the best in PHX. Highly recommended.,Service,,,
Good taste customer service and price for all you can eat. Restaurant was packed. If I come back to Montreal I will go back to this restaurant.,Service,,Value,
Ambience nice service slowwwww and mediocre food. Menu features lots of Louisiana style dishes all of which lack the true flavor.,Service,Ambience,,
Ordered an iced sugar free decaf Cinnamon Dolce latte with Almond milk. Tasted like burnt sugar water no hint of cinnamon at all. Took a few drinks but it was so awful I threw it out. Got it on my way out but if I had stayed in the mall I would have returned it.,,,,
Their latte is to die for. I walked half an hour to have their latte two days in a row when I was in Toronto. Very smooth. Great coffee.,,,,
The food was great but after a couple of months they served us unfresh meat. I ordered chicken panang curry the meat was hard to chew and completely tasteless like the chicken was re-use or recycled. Never went there again.,,,,
Pretty cool place. We just randomly showed up looking for a late lunch. Pretty easy. You pick what you like fill it out on the bag turn it in and they make it. That easy. They have Come product which is always a plus for me. They had a great selection of sandwiches which made it hard to choose which one. I would definitely come back and try another. Very very friendly staff!,Service,Ambience,,
Let down. I have gone to this location before and it was good. Not this time. I ordered 2 medium Italian subs both about $10.00 a piece. When we went to eat them they only had 4 slices each of ham and salami. Will not be returning again sorry.,,,Value,
Stopped in for a quick pop and to see a friend who was there waiting for us. Beers came in big glasses and were comped over to us because we were playing video poker on the bar machines. How cool is that? Two free beers to lose $25 in the machines while drinking but we had a good time talking and getting caught up in a nice air-conditioned place with great service.,,Ambience,Value,
Simply loved this place. We ordered chicken tikka paneer tikka bhalla chat and almond milk.\nThe place was not crowded decor is simple. Food was delicious will definitely go back. \n\nOur only feedback to extend on weekends till 11-12 at night for late bites.,,Ambience,,
Oh boy this place is Great!!! We have had all of their tacos and their Carne Asada burrito. All have been awesome. Do be warned this place is busy! The line can be intimidating but they move through pretty quickly. Absolutely a must if you love tacos and burritos.,Service,,,
Love these Indian Rotis.The curry is delicious we have mostly called them for delivery and the food is always hot. The only word of caution is that they are very spicy mild/medium is going to be enough unless you like exceptionally spicy food. Try it!,,,,
If you love Tacos then visit this place for great mexcain food and at a fair price Pinatas not included,,,Value,
Good vietnamese sub. Spicy without being overwhelming. Fresh bread lightly toasted. Beef was juicy and tender. Reasonably priced at under $8,,,Value,
This was our favorite yogurt and super convenient- now the Scottsdale/Shea location is closed by the landlord and took over the premises due to financial reasons. Too bad...,,,,
"My zinfandel was very nice but be warned the food portions are really small. When I complained about paying $12 for a shallow cup of (not very meaty) bison chili my waiter said ""Oh yes it\'s all small plates tapas style."" I pointed out that the menu says ""plates"" not ""small plates"" he was just like ""it\'s small plates."" Okay thanks. Also the tiny pork taco ($5) came with a strange sauce that tastes like pimento cheese dip.",,,Value,
Loved the place staff was very friendly and informative food was great (a bit pricey) all in all a great experence!!!,,,Value,
"The entree was pretty good.. filet was cooked perfect.. the chicken was a little over cooked.. and the sushi was just ""ok."" The ""experience"" wasn\'t quite as fun as Wasabi- the chefs there are a little more entertaining. I will come back again but am hoping next time it\'s a little more fun.",,,,
Great pizza hands down awesome crust and toppings. We had the Forager and the balance between mushrooms meatiness and spinach earthiness was spot on. Good service and modest price makes this is a winner choice. Arugula and delicate squash salad was very unique and not too sweet in spite of the cranberry pur\xc3\xa9e and citrus dressing. Give it a try if you are in the mood to try something different.,,,,
Best Starbucks in my experience \nQuick service positive attitude and good coffee great muffins :),Service,,,
best sushi in the east valley. quality rolls rolls are a really good size. the nigiri is thick not skimpy.,,,,
Visited for lunch my second time today and both times everything including service has been outstanding. First time: red pork curry; today green chicken curry. SO delicious nice and hot and perfect portions too. Thai On Demand is a definite go-to for great quality great food and again service too. See you again soon (and next time to try the pork belly fried rice the nice people sitting next to me convinced me to enjoy...).,Service,,Value,
Their Pho has the best meatballs and the serving size is perfect!,,,Value,
Coffee is fresh - asked for espresso grind and received something so coarse that would be great for French press.Quite disappointing.,Service,,,
"Great yogurt and great service. We came down from EMR after learning that our local yogurt shop closed down. Anyway it\'s unfortunate that some have left terrible reviews about this place. All these self proclaimed ""foodies"" nitpick at every little detail. Makes me sick. If you don\'t like something don\'t come back. Simple.",Service,,,
"Great food. Great prices and friendly services. I try pho and my friend have "" bo luc lac"". It\'s really good too. Definitely come back.",Service,,,
"Q Haute is beautiful restaurant in a great location. They try WAY to hard to make the presentation interesting which ends up compromising their serving size as well as the food quality in some cases. Their interesting items were ""out there"". If you\'re looking for a nice meal without all the awkward showcasing and snobbery then this is not the place for you. Excellent service though---wish the chefs didn\'t try so hard to be so unique.",Service,,Value,Location
My husband and I went here last night and he had the endless shrimpand I had the platter of lobster tail salmon wild rice shrimp & Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were cooked too hard and burnt. The bread took forever to come out however my server had great customer service. I might not go back for awhile.,Service,,,
Amazing service super nice! Jasmine and mark made my experience amazing and I will def be back to this location !,Service,,,
Orange chicken was not great. Pork fried rice was dry. Only thing good was the egg roll. Not nearly on par with the original on 7th street. Would not recommend.,,,,
This place is delicious. We found it on accident a year ago while in Vegas and remembered to eat here again. Portions are big prices are small and food is super yummy. The owner is so sweet. Lots of regulars in and out showing how good it truly is. Thank you!,Service,,Value,
Really like this place. The broth was quite flavourful and he decor is quite peaceful and quiet. Service is quiet fast as well so you can grab a quick bite really fast. Would come back again,,Ambience,,
Your pizza is crap your people are crap your menu is crap. You take up space on skip the dishes. Its not a free second pizza. Go away. You are a waste of internet bandwidth. I have never seen a worse pizza than this. Your pizzas look like the kind I made when I was 8 years old with play dough.,,,,
Avocado and macha boba tea taste so weird. The worst boba tea in the world I have tried,,,,
Server knowledge poor. We asked questions and received incorrect answers leading to ordering items we would not have ordered. Also the spinach with garlic was horrible. Crab cakes would not eat again. The best item we were served was mashed potatoes. We added more butter from bread loaf and pepper and they were pretty decent. For almost a 100 dinner highly disappointed and will not return.,Service,,,
Really enjoy this great neighbourhood restaurant. My girlfriend and I have been here 4 times over the last couple of months. The service is fast food is tasty and the prices are great.,Service,,Value,
At another recent trip to Humble Pie after work with friends I was introduced to a slightly off-menu item that has to be tried to be appreciated. Order the Garlic & Potato pizza and then ask them to include Pancetta as a topping. The combination of all of the flavors really works together: the bacon-y goodness of the pancetta the herbal notes from the rosemary-seasoned potatoes the rich roasted garlic and pungent Gorgonzola. A new favorite!,,,,
Great place to eat! Wonderful vegetarian vegan and gulten free options. In fact they have a separate menu for all gulten free folks. Lots of options a must place to visit!,,,Value,
Beautiful place with warm home atmosphere. The food just to die for everything is fresh and delicious.,,Ambience,,
The food is pretty good but there are no limes for the tacos. The burritos i find to be too salty. I would give more stars but the customer service is awful.,Service,,,
Fresh ingredients and Mexican food together? Best thing ever. Great service and an awesome menu!! I highly recommend the nacho steak!! Enough to feed a family!! Great price and great food!! I am so coming back!,Service,,Value,
Great salad and Forno fire pizza. Casual and straight forward. Good prices for mid centre of Montreal,,,Value,
This store is one of my preferred places to do grocery. A really nice selection of fresh good quality fruits and vegetables  some of them from either Europe or South America. The store presents a variety of fresh seafood lambpork and beef  so tasty. The service is excellent and stuff very helpful. The chocolate and candies section makes you feel you are in a trip to Europe. I recommend this store to all my friends.,,,,
I am between 3 and 4 stars-service and ambience are a 4 or even a 5. Carrot cake pancakes breakfast flatbread and apple french toast are all 4 (would be a 5 if a but more generous portions). Skillets need some work-dry toast and dry potatoes. Keilbasa was awesome but chicken apple sausage was dry enough to be inedible (and certainly not anything resembling sausage)! Add some hollendaise sauce and those skillets are punched up to a 4 or even a 5. Clean and lovely xmas decor!,Service,Ambience,,
Nice for lunch and dinner and fast enough for a work lunch. \n\nI got the Heirloom Tomato & Wood Roasted Corn salad with salmon added; delicious! The spiced watermelon and pickled radish in the salad are so good - never had watermelon or radish that way. \n\nService was quick and we sat at a hightop near the open terrace. \n\nThey serve yaka mein which I saw on Anthony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmern (I forget) once which I am definitely going to try soon.,,Ambience,,
Horrible!! I do not really care about the quality of the food since the service here was so bad that I will never go here again. The people were very rude. If negative star was an option I would certainly have opted for that.,Service,,,
They delivered fast food was fresh hot delicious we had house fried rice and sesame seed chicken egg drop wonton soup it was totally awesome..The best in town,,,,
The better Gen.\nOur server was named rufio.\nPretty good food man.\nNo long lines.\nService quick.\nAnd friendly.\nGo for it.,Service,Ambience,,
I have only been here once and opted for the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad. It was really yummy. I went on a weekday for lunch with a coworker who got the pizza lunch special with pepperoni which he enjoyed. Our server was attentive. I have since been told they have a GF pizza crust so on a future visit would like to try it. They have a humongous wine rack on the main wall when you walk in. Overall the visit was pretty good.,Service,,,
Great location have been there 8 times this month...seriously!!! I updated my previous review because i have gone to other locations. This one id by far the best!!!,,,,Location
"Love that all the good places from China Town are opening up in the SW. Food was great and the service was as well. Max was our ""server"" idk what you\'d call um lol. The decor inside is really nice. Went for lunch so was a little disappointed I couldn\'t get the kalbi as its only a dinner item.",Service,Ambience,,
Great authentic food. I recommend the chicken tacos. The tortillas are all handcrafted and delicious! Not being able to speak Spanish was not an issue. There is always someone able to help should I need assistance ordering. They just remodeled and the new addition is very impressive.,Service,Ambience,,
So the only place on the strip that makes them hot is at Planet Hollywood Casino. This one does actually have a real location with variety as opposed to some gift shop in a casino that will sell you a donut.,,,,Location
The food here is amazing! You have plenty of healthy and tasty options. I usually get the chicken and fresh grilled veggies. The tofu is seasoned and I highly recommend that as well. Another appealing aspect of this restaurant is that there is a sauce bar with sauces made from scratch ranging from the always yummy teriyaki to more exotic flavors like sweet garlic and Fuji yummy. Eat here!,,,,
I had visited yama sushi over labor day weekend and they had the best poki salad ive had in the states in a very long time we will return soon again just for the food. The service was average could use improvement. The food was great though.,Service,,,
Best meal we had in Toronto. Great atmosphere wonderful service delicious saki and the Yuzu roll is amazing. \n\nThe seaweed salad also gets an honorable mention as the addition of coriander sprouts is BRILLIANT and adds a whole new dimension to an old favorite.,Service,Ambience,,
Takada Thai is an answer to my prayers a great Thai restaurant in my zip code! The food is excellent the people are friendly and gracious the prices are fair. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah atmosphere it has plenty of it is decorated wonderfully and is quiet and nice and just a great place for lunch or dinner. I take all my business clients there and they are always pleasantly surprised.\n\nTim,Service,Ambience,Value,
Love this store. Great prices on everything. They have makeup diapers formula even. So much stuff for low prices. Example i got a huge 5 lb can of sliced pears for 2.99! Cannot beat that. \nThe store has a cafe area and you can get a bite to eat. Post office inside as well which is convenient. If you spend $50 or more you get to spin a wheel you spin to win gift cards and a percentage of money to be taken off your total. Amazing place. You MUST go if you are on a tight budget.,Service,,Value,
"I was very angry!!! The cashier was trying to lie to me on the price!!! I ordered 1 pike place 1 Apple cider and 1 sandwich and I was told the total was $29.27... How come?! I asked the cashier how much was it for each item and she was trying to avoid talking to me... And a supervisor said ""sorry"" to me... I didn\'t understand why the cashier did that!! I mean it is Starbucks!!!! I was really disappointed!!!!!",Service,,,
Just good is a bit deceptive they\'re actually great. If you like sugary crap like Krispy Kreme it\'s probably not for you. If you like a pleasantly sweet treat that\'s well balanced in flavor check them out. Vindaloo maple bacon donut is one of my favorites but it\'s hard to wrong with any of them. My favorite spot to stop on my way to work and win Friday mornings.,,,,
I give them five stars because:\n\n1) service is fast\n2) food is delicious\n3) variety of foods available\n4) located around the most priciest sushi joints downtown\n5) CHEAP\n6) REASONABLE PRICINGS\n7) AFFORDABLE\n8) they give milkshake candies\n9) cute for dating or catching up with friends\n\nThats all,Service,Ambience,Value,Location
Best Vietnamese in town!!! Great to take out or dinning is lovely & very clean. Also appreciate the large potions you are always guaranteed plenty of food!,,,Value,

Horrible experience in this restaurant . It was good before  but the food was taste horrible now !! The seafood is not fresh at all !! And some of the food r not cooked !!!,,,,
The best breadsticks and awesome calzones. There is a big selection of food to choose from. The staff is always friendly!,Service,,,
Absolutely fabulous restaurant in Las Vegas. Likely all around best. Menu is easy to order from with 3 fixed price menus. Lobster & avocado salad a standout. Best Moscow mule I ever had. Professional servers are friendly and helpful. Decorative cloth ceiling and walls dampen sound levels resulting in a quiet meal. Tables well separated. Everything makes the cost well worth it.,Service,Ambience,Value,
Love this place! Hidden little jem! All natural grass fed burgers great flavor and awesome dressings! Definitely a great find!,,,,
Gave me two cheese instead of pepperonis offered to exchange once I drove away and was at the event which is obviously not possible.\n\nThey offered to put pepperoni on them and throw them back in the oven need to find a new place for pizza.,Service,,,
Horrible disgusting old tasting food. My fiance and I are sick. Food was cold. Had to give it back twice. Best believe this is going to court it made us that sick. We are both sick in bed instead of enjoying our Superbowl Sunday. Beware do not eat here!,,,,
Since moving from Chicago where pizza is amazing I was looking for something like home. And i found it at Rosattis. Live everything about it.,,,,
Amazing food! Everything was phenomenal! The waiter was super helpful. All of his recommendations were spot on. Must do Singapore salad of course. Plenty of veggies options for the vegetarian in the group. Desert was also phenomenal. Top 5% of meals ever!,Service,,Value,
Free wifi with purchase of an item. Score!! \n\nThis place is a little bit of heaven while in the Sin City. I was out here for a conference and had some work to get done. I went here a couple of days using the free WI-FI and drinking all the various teas they offer. \n\nGreat service huge selection and good customer service.,Service,,Value,
Great Deli. House-made products local products fresh food great prices. I usually get the entr\xc3\xa9e with 2 sides and a drink for $6-$7. Generously portioned and tastes just like Mom made it. Prepared meats for cooking at home are awesome. 4 stars because post-lunch-rush items can be dry.,,,,
This is one of the best sushi places in Montreal. We ordered a combo for delivery. We were very happy with the quantity and the quality.,,,Value,
Went for a late night meal on a Friday. Quite comfortable setting with great food and a good beer / wine selection.,,Ambience,Value,
Disaster for customer service. I was quoted 15 minutes and waited 40. People working there seemed clueless. Salad was terrible. Pizza very expensive. The one in Chandler is better. Stay away from this location!!!!,Service,,,
Love this place for burritos the fries are also pretty darn delicious too! I highly recommend giving it a try. Its a nice variety from the other options available nearby.,,,Value,
Potbelly make a fantastic sandwich. I particularly like the Wreck on a flatbread with their mustard hot peppers with LTO. Recently they have been offering a BOGO if you return within two days. I have tried a variety of their sandwiches and have not been disappointed yet. Give it a try if you are looking for something new to try for lunch.,,,,
Would not recommend. Slow service Saturday night. Food was nothing special. Poor quality for the price. Mains are $20+. For my chicken fratacelli: the pasta was not al dente and the chicken was charred. We waited over an hour for the food to come. Even drinks and bread service was slow. Bottle of beer took close to 15 minutes to arrive at the table. \nSpend your time and money elsewhere.,Service,,Value,

This was my first and last visit here. The food was absolutely disgusting! It was bland and greasy. I paid almost 15 bucks for 1 taco 1 nacho with 1 drink and caso sauce. The soda machine was out of over half of its flavors. The salsa bar was a mess it took over a dozen of napkins to clean myself up from all the grease. Taco bell would have been a better choice!!,Service,Ambience,Value,
They seem to be mind readers because the food comes extremely fast and the prices are great. Samosas are yummy soup is a nice spicy broth with tofu and mushrooms and the pad see ew and pad kee mow are your standard noodle dishes. If you like spicy I would probably go with a 9 or 10. I got an 8 and definitely could have handled more spice.,Service,,,
"This breakfast place was ""as advertised "". Several yelpers complained about service the fact is that this place has outstanding food and as a result it is very busy. We waited 35 minutes (which is what they told us when we arrived). The host staff was very efficient in seating folks and in (what seemed like) a short time were seated. I had a Bloody Mary (with chocolate dipped bacon!) which was great. Dark roasted real coffee too. I had the maple chorizo French toast. All good! Eat here!",Service,,,
A hole-in-the wall in Target strip mall we FINALLY found our go-to Chinese place. It was busy for 4:00 on a Saturday. Friendly service fresh and tasty food and great prices!,Service,,Value,Location
"Seriously the best place in Scarborough for wings. They do a daily special of a pound and fries for 9.95. Their fries are fresh cut in house and the wings are fantastic. There\'s also a 8:30pm till 11:30pm wing ""hour"" where you can get a pound for 5.95 with veggies and dip! With daily drink specials including weekends you can\'t go wrong for a cheap night out close to home.",,,,
Support this place!!!! I go several times a week before school for their cold brew coffee or killer iced teas! Try the almond cookie tea or Orange creme tea! BOMB!!,,,,
Food was so gooood! Love their rissoto! Got the osso buco risotto the first time a lot of meat and very tasty. Got the sausage rissotto the second time not much meat but still very tasty. Friends got the cheese gnocchi and it was delicious. \nRestaurant was quite empty the two times we went without reservation. But for some reason the waitress kept rushing us out. They stopped refilling our water after we paid.,Service,,,
We had dinner her last night. Very good! Staff was so attentive. Even took the time to bring different items to our table and then help us cook them. A great experience!,Service,,,
I had a craving for Pho so yelped this and was satisfied. Noodles were a bit undercooked but overall broth was decent restaurant was clean and quiet. I had ordered the large Pho but it was soo big I had to bring some home for left overs.,,Ambience,,
Tried this yesterday and was impressed. Excellent service and the food was very tasty. Will be back for sure!,Service,,,
Poor value for the quantity and quality of food. Save your money and eat at a decent sit down.,,,Value,
Easily the most original idea I have seen in a long time. The owners are genius!! 5 stars any day of the week!!!,,,,
The calamari appetizer was probably best calamari I have had anywhere not close to the ocean. Green curry chicken is excellent dish as well. Flavorful and colorful.,,,,
Yeah bro. This place for sure bro. Really awesome employees at this location. You know Dutch Bros have a rep and this place solidifies it.,Service,,,
Stopped here today for lunch. Ordered pizza by the slice. 1 hour later our pizza came without an apology of the delay of the pizza. It was not crowded at all at the restaurant. A family came in after us we received their bread sticks they took it off our table and handed it to their table. Is that even sanitary? They also received their full pizza before we got ours. \n\nPizza was greasy and tasted like jar sauce. crust was good.,Service,,,
Absolutely delicious. Garlic naan was on point as was the samosa chat and tandoori house platter. All reasonably priced. \nThey grossly underestimated how long it would take for the food to be ready but it was still worth the wait. I will definitely be back!,,,Value,
Awesome fillet mignon! Just right. Colossal potato was delicious. This place never disappoints.,,,,
"Worst customer service ever. I brought my 8 month pregnant wife from the east end for ice cream. We were behind the designated last person. Literally the next people. And they wouldn\'t give us an ice cream. The girl behind the counter yelled ""no guys I have exams"". She denied my pregnant wife....never will I forget this horrible day.",Service,,,
Decent Chinese typical offerings and atmosphere. This is a place that you take out and call ahead. I think that it depends what you get here. Their egg drop soup is one of my favorites and my husband said it is in his top 5 for general tsos but..... their chicken with broccoli is bland. I would say try it out.,,Ambience,,
"My son went in to pay for gas and use the bathroom and when he came out he said "" mom rate them. They have great customer service."" Thanks for making his day. Staff on 6/14/2017 at 8:25 pm",Service,,,
will go back. the food was very good. I went with a bunch of friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. service was great .. always smiling attentive and polite. the indoor decor was sophisticated but it was a relaxing dining experience on a summer evening ... and bonus points for having the jays game on as cecil shut down tampa bay.,Service,Ambience,,
Great airport food. It was a toss up between this spot and the burger place next door. I chose right! Had a carnitas burrito to go. Was a tiny bit dry but solid for an airport. Came with good salsa and was packed with meat. They normally have jalape\xc3\xb1os to add but were out today. That might have made this burrito a 5!,,,Value,
Hole in the wall establishment gets 3.5 stars. Only one staff waiting table and the wifey cooking all the meals. I had hu tieu special really enjoyed the home made shrimp cakes in it didnt care for the imitation crab and wontons. \n\nPho was above average in my opinion although portions were on the smaller side.,,,Value,
I found this place with my friends the other week. And oh my gosh! I adore the atmosphere of this place and the staff is incredibly helpful and kind. The food is to die for and if you want more bang for your buck then go during happy hour (Monday through Friday 4 until 7) \nI will definitely go back here soon!,Service,Ambience,Value,
First time we came to this place and have to say it was great! Green corn tamales were great and the pollo fundido is yummy. Check this place out if you have a chance.,,,,
This is a neighborhood restaurant no frills and a little old fashioned but I love this place! Service is great and you are always greeted with a friendly smile. \n\nI usually order the grilled salmon with fries. Awesome! Their coleslaw is homemade creamy goodness. They have a terrific selection of desserts as well. Try the creamy rice pudding or the cheesecake. Its wonderful!,Service,,,
Great little cafe in the fashion district. The interior was bright and cozy. There were plenty of seats and tables for customers to use. I ordered a Spanish latte and it is like a regular latte with a bit of cajun. The addition of the cajun spice gave the latte a very distinguished flavour that makes me want to go back for another cup!,,Ambience,,Location
Wow.. I have been wanting to try Greek Wraps since I moved to Glendale in August.. finally did and it was AMAZING. Who thought you would find incredible kabobs in Glendale!!

"The owners and the staff are amazing. There was a lady with blonde hair at hostess station who was incredibly rude. I had called and made a reservation for my daughters birthday earlier in the week for for 3 people. When we got there we gave our name and told her we had a reservation and she looked at us and said "" we don\'t take reservations for 3"" and then just looked at us. Luckily Marie stepped in and took us to out table.\nThe food was amazing!",Service,,,
We stopped by here after going to the aquarium across the street. For $10 you get 2 bottles of beer and a souvenir glass. The tour guide wears a microphone and everyone in the tour group gets a headset so that they do not have any difficulty hearing anything. The tour is short but fun. Its a nice clean brewery. I have to say the employees looked very happy.,Service,,Value,Location

Delicious ice cream but long line. The pear creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was wonderful. Cash only though.,,,,
What a charming little place. Rigatoni with meat sauce was to die for. Great salads. Great desserts. The owner came over to schmooze with us so we felt right at home. Make a reservation or you will have a long wait (if you get in at all).,Service,Ambience,Value,
Unfortunately this was a let down. Watching a staff member scratch his beard then his head then dig in his ears several times before handling plates and delivering food to tables was a turn off for sure. The flat iron steak was good pasta not so much. I think we will head to town for dinners the rest of our stay at McCormick Ranch.,Service,,,
One of the best kept burger secrets in this town. Sweet potato fries and a burger you will not soon forget.,,,,
I love this pizza venezias was my favorite until I found this place. Their hot sauce is amazing and if you like jalepenos they are actually hot and delicious not to mention the have yummy ranch too! Mmmmm gooood.,,,,
My new favorite brunch spot! I visit this area a lot to watch movies or eat at the restaurants around here but I never noticed this place until I searched yelp for brunch places.

Everything tasted it came from food cans especially the beans and the salad from bags from the supermarket,,,,
I had the rib eye steak and the crab claws. The food was excellent but on par for Las Vegas standards. Service was excellent and fast.\n\nThe crab cake was tasty with a small portion.,Service,,Value,
Very good cheese pizza. Thin crust with a bit of char. I dined in and the owner and his assistant left out the back door for the last 10 minutes I was there. Strange. I grabbed my own to-go box off the counter and left.,Service,,,
The cheese sauce on Nachos and Macaroni & Cheese used to be amazing 5 cheese blend.....the price of Macaroni & Cheese went up $2.00 but they changed recipe! Used to be large shell pasta with the amazing cheese sauce. Now it is horrible; regular elbow macaroni & what does not taste as good as Velveeta cheese. PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD RECIPE MACARONI & CHEESE!! I WILL CHANGE RATING TO 5 STARS....PLEASE!,,,Value,
The service was quick and our server made solid recommendations of the menu. The time that I came was for a brunch event. This event including a DJ - the DJ made his way around the room and worked to make all feel welcomed. The waffle was sweet and soft and the chicken was a mix of sweet and spicy. Price was unbeatable.,Service,Ambience,Value,
"Gross dry food.. Tasted like it was sitting out all day. They were really fast on handing my order out too less than a minute in the drive thru for a 4 for $4 a large fry and chicken fries?? How could you make all of that fresh in less than a minute? Oh wait they just grab it off the counter where it\'s been sitting all day. Also asked for ""a lot"" of ranch and buffalo sauce and she gave me one of each!!! (One sauce for a 9 piece and a 4 piece?!) never coming here again!!!",,,,
The Pizza in Charlotte bar none.This place has true NY pizza. I love it and go at least once a week.,,,,
three stars is about right for this place. Nice menu but the follow through is not there. Food lacked flavor. Beans were not good tasted of out the can. The food is lackluster and would get 2 stars I threw in the third one because of value.,,,Value,

Here is absolutely a good place to stay in hot summer afternoon. They provide free WiFi and air condition inside the store and some sunshades for the seats outside. From my experience less people are in the store in the daytime although it is located in a popular walking region. You may also take some coupons at the corner of street in the afternoon. There is usually a staff who gives coupon to walkers. The food is as usual as other A&W stores nothing special.,,Ambience,Value,
Food was okay but staff is RUDE. Still trying to figure out how I was charged $15 for what should have been $8.95 as lunch special. A bowl of mediocre pasta for $15? Definitely not worth it.,Service,,,
Always a good experience. Seating outside in the summer to have lunch or dinner and people watch is something everyone should do once in a while on 17 Avenue.,,,,
Wow the Spencer steak was incredible!\nThe meat was very tender with delicious rich flavor.\nGreat prices great good excellent service.,Service,,Value,
Went there with a homerun.com certificate. Food and service were excellent. The wait staff paid attention but not too much. The food was hot and very good. Presentation was excellent. If you want a relaxing night out this is a great place!,Service,Ambience,,
A little better than average But pricy for a little pizza joint with nothing really special,,,Value,
Never tried this pizza place. It came recommended so I ordered a large pizza. Very disappointing. Although the crust was just okay everything on top of crust was very skimpy. Will not go back.,,,,
Pissed! Waited in this line for 25 min... only for them to tell me once I got to the front of the line that they were out of tortillas!!!!!! I will NEVER come back they took entirely too long,Service,,,
First time here and ordered the JAFFNA. Amazing!!! Plenty of toppings. The crust was crunchy yet soft on the inside. It tasted just as amazing when toasted later in the day or the next day!! Need to return to try the other pizzas!!!!,,,,
3rd time here and was super good . This time I got the shrimp scampi hands down the best in town . They even have a vegan dish for my wife and she said it was the best . So if you up for pasta try this spot .,,,,
This is by far one of the worst Starbucks. The place is very busy and while the servers are quick they are far from polite. Usually when drink errors are made Starbucks is more than willing to fix it but here the staff are almost combative. Everytime I have gone here too it is as if the ac is broken. The interior is warm and stale. It makes you long for the chipolte next door. Bottom Line: SKip this SB and head across the lot to Chompies.,Service,Ambience,,
First week a little disappointing. Beautiful presentations. Charming decor. Nice waite staff. Definitely will return.,Service,Ambience,,
I grabbed an iced almond milk dropout for the road after eating brunch at the restaurant. It tasted great nice and bold. I liked that they had milk alternatives. Lots of interesting flavor combos to choose from and a variety if pastries that looked tasty. I look forward to coming back and trying some other things off the menu.,,,,
Was pleasantly surprised that they still have stock on a Sunday before the September long weekend.\n\nI went around 17:00 and they still had a decent amount of fruits & veggies left (they only had a handful of green onions but good enough for me!). The store is very clean and offers plenty of parking out front. The cashiers have always been efficient in checking out.,Service,Ambience,,
Robin went above and beyond to take care of a small mistake that was made in the kitchen. Truly appreciative me and my gf continuously receive tasty food for great prices and this is one of the better locations that serve Las Vegas. Thank so much Robin and the rest of the team!,Service,,,
After searching for a local bakery in the area I came upon Hurst Bakery. The custom cake I ordered was ready on time delicious and beautifully decorated. I would definitely recommend this place.,,,,
What do you expect? I wavered from my usual Club and had the Buffalo Chicken to. Not bad. Not great.\n\nI am glad they finally switched the kids meal bags. We have way too many of them.\n\nThey added more seating outside.,,Ambience,,
Simple great tasting food aptly named for its northern Sonora style . The frijoles charros are a wonderful start. Fresh limeade tacos de asada--authentic feel at a great price.,,,,
Ive ordered lots of indian in the city and apalla does it just the way i like it. The tikka masala is amazing and anything else ive tried has always been good and worth ordering twice. \nService is friendly and during the week quite speedy service. Weekends a little longer but thats to be expected :)\nThis is a go to spot for ordering in dinner for me! Highly recommend with great vegetarian options as well!,,,,
I came in with high expectation but the food is nothing but meh hotmess roll tastes like a big chunk of rice and imitation crab top with spicy mayo sauce the Sakana plate ( chef choice) came in a small portion and the chef gave us egg for a sashimi platter?! Rip off:( last but not least... The rock shrimp tempurait taste like those fried popcorn shrimp I can find in any Chinese restaurant it also came with tons of saucy grease I know which restaurant to avoid when I come to Vegas next time.,Service,,Value,
Not a place for authentic Mexican food but if you are looking for gringo southwest food where you can take lightweights from the east coast to it is ok. I do like their salsa. Lots of flavor but not very spicy. The guacamole is a overpriced rip off. It is what it is.,,,Value,
Ordered pizza and wings. Food was ready for pick up. Food tasted good not really outstanding in any way. The ranch dressing was fresh and appeared to be made at the restaurant. Kinda expensive for XL pizza and half a bucket of wings(20 wings). $41+. Glad I went to pick it up to avoid tipping.,,,Value,
Cheap food that tastes good! Nice salad bar too!! 4 people ate lunch for 28$ what a deal!!,,,Value,
If your going here I recommend not ordering the lamb shack it is very bland and very chewy my friend ordered the linguine that actually tasted good but sadly I had the lamb shack! :(,,,,
Great place had the shrimp tacos sorry forget the name very good. I also tried the Asian taco that was amazing watch out little Spicy. Friday night the had live music which was not to loud. Enjoyable!!!!,,Ambience,,
Food was not fresh despite their claiming otherwise. Overpriced items and not worth the value at all.,,,Value,
Had their burrito with steak potatoes and cheese. So worth the price! I will be going back :),,,Value,

"these ppl only have one employee which makes it hard for me to buy containers of haagen daaz multiple times a week or day! that cheeky bastard always goes ""haha ice cream again eh?"" fuck you i have an eating disorder! need a bigger variety of employees so i can avoid the judgment! and these assholes are stingy as hell giving out bus change!",Service,,,
My taste buds were not wowed nor satisfied. I ordered a chili cheese dog & fries. My fries were warm not hot which leads me to believe they had been sitting under a heat lamp. The chili cheese dog was good not great. I was expecting a more seasoned or flavorful chili. But I did like the chunks of meat in it. Overall it was fair not great. Doubt I would be back or tell someone else to give it a try.,,,,
The food was great the service smh not so great maybe they were having a bad day but I would eat there again,Service,,,
Best pizza in TOWN!!!! Such a great atmosphere great service and the pizza is THE BEST IN THIS WORLD!!!!! I always order Chicago style so yummy!!! I had my birthday there and got a Sangria soooo good!!! I highly recommend this restaurant so happy they are opening one at Green Valley Ranch Cassino! :D,Service,Ambience,,
First of all the food was very expensive and you got very little for your money. I ordered two chili rienos. There was two as advertised and they were very very small. About two and half inches long by 1 inch wide.,,,Value,
$32.95 for all you can eat on Sundays thru Thursdays 5pm to 7pm what a great deal! The service was outstanding and the quality of the Japanese food was the best! Really liked the atmosphere we sat at the sushi bar and the aquarium was a great background for our dinner.,Service,Ambience,Value,
Uncomplicated and delicious.\nCame here for an early dinner on a Tuesday.\nI ordered the guac and chips  the campechano taco( everything taco) and the camarones taco (shrimp). Tacos are $4.5 each \n\nThe Campechano taco was definitely the star of the night but watch out for the spicy sauce it is quite spicy and will leave your mouth on fire.\n\nI also tried their feature cocktail with hibiscus tea? it was just meh.\n\nUpbeat latin music plays in the background. Enjoy!,,Ambience,Value,
Very friendly staff. We had chocolate malt and half chocolate/Jamaica shake. Both were delish.,Service,,,
REAL cookie dough?? Yep. Need I say more.?\nNo but I will... Comfy couches wifi and toys for the kids:),,Ambience,,
This was a great location for a family meal. Lots of parking and the restaurant was very spacious. Families with rambunctious kids could enjoy a meal without disturbing other patrons. The menu has a variety of options but is pretty standard when it comes to AYCE restaurants.,,,,Location
Food is alright but the staff always seem like there in a bad mood.,Service,,,
The hot cakes are very good. In the winter they use frozen strawberry but they use fresh ones in summer. My favorite one is walnut banana hot cake. The service is very fast because they always have a long line. The waiter service is ok. For 7 to 8 dollar per person breakfast the price is good.,Service,,Value,
Specialty: Ramen in Clam based soup. Not as flavourful as it was hyped up to be. Noodles were al dante and bouncy but I think i still prefer tonokotsu base personally.\n\nHad to line up still :(,,,,
Great place for burritos quesadillas or salad. Go here instead of Chipotle. Staff is always very friendly and hard working. I eat here at least once per week. My only beef is paying $7 for a cheese quesadillas but it is delicious so worth the price.,Service,,Value,
If you want cheap authentic well seasoned mexican food this place is great.\n\nI have been twice (dine in once take out once) and yes the previous reviewers are not exagerating about the broken english. I have had the enchiladas verde enchiladas rojas and the enchiladas covered in mole. Of those three the ehchiladas verde are by far my favorite.,,,Value,
"Noisy fun fast place. Great cocktails a speciality. Limited wine list. Sardine tartines to die for as was the Belgian endive boat-like salad. the unusual mushroom egg dish was very fresh the beef bourguignon small for $16. Clearly Begonia will be an ""in spot"" for a while.",,,Value,
Good food but when you pay with the visa you have to have at least $15 spend to use it. Was forced to give a $5 tip.,,,Value,
Great family owned & operated Italian resturant. Perfect size dishes with very reasonable prices. Would highly recommend this place if you want a home cooked Italian meal!,,,Value,
Been coming here for 17 years plus! The lamb and cheese dip is phenomenal! Highly recommended and great for family and very kid friendly! Great environment!,,Ambience,,
Parking 5 out of 5\nService 4out of 5\nFood 5 out of 5\nFood is great especially #26 beef stew noodle soup & # 29 central Vietnamese beef noodle soup! \nOnly downfall is food takes a very long time to prepare. When ordering take out staff advise 25mins but you still wait when up u come to pick up for another 10-15mins. Give yourself lots of time when dinning in or taking out!,Service,,,
When visiting Montreal I knew I had to try this place for the cronuts. I stopped in while on my way home from Montreal and picked up 2. They were a bit smaller than I imagined but given the sweetness once I got into them the size is good. They really are as tasty as I had hoped though *really* oily and greasy. I would have a hard time paying $8 for 2 again but I definitely enjoyed them.,,,Value,
Love Sumo Sushi - we go for the all you can eat option. I try different rolls and they are all good but my favorites are the spicy variety. The seaweed salad is delicious. At lunch time we had a party of 5 got served right away. Dinner time party of 4 and party of 2 both times we were served right away.,Service,,,
Visiting from Philadelphia . Food tastes awful. Chicken was very dry. And I got very sick within a few hours of eating. I would stay away from this place.,,,,
very quiet atmosphere great for a nice romantic evening I loved it! pasta was quite good. We have seen this place forever and finally decided to go in. we will go back again!!!,,Ambience,,
Pass on this place. Poor customer service poor delivery service. Lady at restaurant called us liars. They just lost a regular customer! Get your act together save yourself the frustration and order elsewhere!,Service,,,
I cannot say I loved it but I did not hate it either. Like the decor I have to say it did not taste bad but it was absolutely bland! I ordered the signature roll (tuna and yellowtail) and the Dynamite roll (spicy tuna and salmon) but I could not distinguish which was spicy or the salmon versus yellowtail. It all tasted the same but I would say try it for yourself! The price was good and the staff were pleasant!,Service,Ambience,,
Love this place! They have wonderful tasting burgers and sides. Choices also include chicken turkey salmon and vegetarian burgers- all with a great smokey taste. They have Gluten free buns too so your GF friends will be able to eat a real burger! Great friendly service.,Service,,Value,
Great place and outstanding food. If you want something authentic you have to checkout Back Yard Taco. Its not your traditional mexican food the Crazy Potato is amazing and I love the street tacos. I have already referred many family and friends.\n\nCheck them out you will be glad you do or your LOCO if you dont!,,,,
Always the bomb for good food. Did I mention the fries are crazy delicious?!?!,,,,
First time had the avocado burger with sweet potato fries delicious. very clean and enjoyable. Burger was a little greasy but tasty. Also had nutter butter shake really good. Yummmm,,,,
Good basic food salmon and salads are all wonderful. It does get busy for dinner make a reservation. pasta dishes are tasty.,,,,
Good stuff. We had our Pop Warner banquet here in one of the private back dining rooms. This is a great casual dining atmosphere and if you need a casual meeting space for your business or organization on the East Independence area this would be a great choice.,Service,Ambience,,
Delicious! One of my favorite places to go! The best tacos in all of central phoenix!,,,,
"Ok the last time I was in this shack President Carter and Billy Beer hit the USA. Nothing has changed just aged a bit.\n\nAnd as Samuel L Jackson would say ""Mmmmmm...this IS a tasty burger.""",,,,
Great food fast service and awesome margaritas! Will definitely be back for another visit.,Service,,,
5 star pizza seriously good!\n\nReally generous salads albeit not as gourmet as the pizza.\n\nDown to earth environment felt like Italy again!,,Ambience,,
Great service and the food was amazing. We ordered the nachos and even though you only get 8 pieces they were the tastiest bites ever. Each bite was loaded with guacamole sour cream refried beans cheese and salsa. I ordered the double cheeseburger for my main which melted like butter and my friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich which she loved. Everything was seasoned well and the flavours complimented one another.,Service,,Value,
Authentic Greek Food the ribs were delicious and the Greek Salad was excellent. Friendly service. We will definitely be back.,Service,,,
Food and service was great. Place was busy but we only had to wait 5 mins. Portions are big. I had the s&s burrito (see pic),Service,,Value,
"This place is so cool! I went here the other day with my boyfriend after I was done with work. I love the fact you order in front and they bring it too you. \n\nMy boyfriend got the French toast and an iced coffee. I didn\'t have a bite but it looked so amazing. The French toast was covered with fluffy whipped cream and strawberries. \n\nI got the ""trio"" where they list different breakfast items and you get to choose! It was perfect and the potatoes were fabulous:)",Service,Ambience,,
I had a taste for good Jamaican/Caribbean food and found this place on Google. The food was so good! I had the Jerk chicken with peas and rice cabbage and Mac and Cheese. Very good it hit the spot! Will be going back in the future.,,,,
Their chocolate covered strawberries are amazing and the service from Christine was great. Very clean and friendly area. Will be back for sure.,Service,Ambience,,
I love Andy and he loves me. \n\nI used to come here every Sunday after church and order his special not on the menu rolls. Those are awesome. They are really fresh and flavorful.,Service,,,
If you come to Cleveland this is a must do!! The ice cream is phenomenal and is made with local dairy and products! \nThe Wildberry Crumble is awesome!,,,,
Their food is amazing and the service is great. I take my family here at least once a week and its always a hit. Looking for some great Chinese food look no further go and get some.,Service,,,
The most fresh and delicious bagels in the area. I also love their pastries. Their customer service is great and the employees are super friendly.,Service,,,
Looking for a place to eat at in The Mirage- but nothing too formal or heavy? The Pantry is a good choice. Open 24/7 they serve breakfast all day and a good selection of lunch and dinner items. I was looking for desert and ended up with some carrot cake and a cookie skillet with ice cream.\n\nThe place was clean service was prompt and the deserts were tasty! Nothing fancy but it was good.\n\nThey also have a full bar and drink specials if you are so inclined!,Service,Ambience,,
Great Burgers get some goat cheese on it\nNo one listens to me about the goat cheese but its really good.\nChocolate oreo shake also deserves note also,,,,
Make sure that you sign up for the Godiva frequent shopper card it scores you one free chocolate a month. Sadly this does not include the super juicy delicious chocolate covered strawberries. Those run $4-5 and are scrumptious. \n\nThe pre-packaged chocolates make nice gifts and the frozen chocolate drinks are rich and refreshing. I really like the raspberry one. \n\nThe store is small and can get crowded on weekends... And some employees are much friendlier then others.,Service,,,
"??? \nIs this place closed down or what? I\'m confused because they still have their ""grand opening promotion"" banner hanging outside but they were very evidently closed when I came to check it out a few nights ago (during supposed operation hours). It was pitch black inside and there were newspapers covering up the windows.\n\nMy friends have also commented that it was it was in a similar condition the last time they came with the intention of trying it out.",,,,
Got food poisoning on 6-14-15. Had to call in sick today. No bueno and no return trip there ever. Bummer....,,,,
Service was not bad but the food was not exceptional. Bland at best. Ate calamari and was chewing on it for 15 mins also had a margarita pizza and there was no flavour.,Service,,,
Can I give a business zero stars? \nBesides the fact that the food is horrible the management is the worst part of this restaurant. As a local barfly myself I know many of the servers personally that worked here and heard nothing but complaints. \n\nTreat your employees badly it gets around. Treat your customers worse it gets around. \n\nBad food bad management. Plain and simple.,Service,,,
Ordered the chicken and mutton biryanis \n\nBoth lacked the flavour. Seems the Chicken and mutton pieces were just thrown without cooking in the biryani,,,,
Delicious food and great candy selection... I love this place!,,,Value,
Workers are always cheery... Never had any problems except once. The young man only put on one glove after handling money and touched my sandwich while wrapping it. Not cool.\n\nThis is my GO TO Subway though...I still go back. They are quick and do a good job.\n\nIf you like bread more soft then overcooked this is your place.,Service,,,
Reasonable prices and friendly staff here. Not the best pho in the city but convenient in the area and good for a quick bite.,Service,,,
Wow! Incredible quality for a little ice cream stand. Typical cones sundaes and milkshakes. But a menu of burgers fries nachos etc. and items like the raspberry toasted almond tort sundae really set this place a part from competitors. Worth the trip.,Service,,Value,
excellent taste and the way they made their home made waffle cone right in front of our eyes was really fascinating. I ended up ordering carmel and my girlfriend ordered strawberry and irish creme. both tasted excellent.\nvery good ice-cream for reasonable price in the heart of Oakland.\nwill visit frequently.,,,Value,
The best. No trendy bar scene here. Just awesome sushi and service. Its not by accident the guy next to me at the bar was from Japan! Hands down my favorite local Sushi!,Service,,,
My favorite ice cream place! Love their chocolate shakes! All the flavors are fantastic!,,,,
I love the cheese steak subs here but in the past year they are less cheesy and have far less meat on them considering they are eight bucks. They are still good but were better,,,Value,
This place hit the spot for a late Saturday lunch. Their $6.50 lunch special is a steal (for TO sushi prices). I ordered the california and salmon roll. Miso soup and salad is included. Additionally I ordered gyoza (which I did not like b/c it was not vegetable gyoza). Clearly I had no intentions of eating dinner! The starter is unnecessary given the amount of food. Washed it down with green tea. \nSatisfied tummy!,,,Value,
"The reasons for not giving them a 5 star:\n\n1. Portion size of the styrofoam burrito bowl is very small. If ure going to compete with major burrito places the current size won\'t cut it.\n\n2. For the price the amount of chicken in the bowl was extremely stingy. I love meat n im satisfied with other burrito places.\n\n3. Customer service was not the best. My first statement was ""I\'ve never been here before"". To that there was silence.\n\nOther than that i really enjoyed their flavor.",Service,,Value,
Stopped here after seeing Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. Three adults and 2 picky kids and all were happy. Each of the meat entrees were delicious- the barbacoa the carnitas and the chicken (with cilantro pesto) were all very good. Beans were a hit too. Creamy and delish. The Jamaica tea is really good and not too sweet. Definitely will be back!,Service,,,
TERRIBLE. Do NOT use them. Ordered food for high school team. Call store and let them know we needed by 5pm. Was informed it would be there by 445pm. After an hour pizzas did not arrive. Then was told pizzas done 30 min ago but no driver. Manager refused to talk with customers.\nAnother 30 min and store call and says they forgot to make 2 of the pizzas. Had to cancel order because match over. Athletes were disappointed and hungry. Use Papa Johns or Dominos.,Service,,,
this location always has a line but it moves so fast !! the food is ALWAYS OMG fresh and delicious always SMOKING hot and smells like heaven! \n\nthey have awesome specials and tons of emploies so they never run out of anything!\n\nI love panda and this is my new fav location!,Service,,,
as the others review says its amazing. so im not going to be talking about how great the pho is cause everyone else is already doing that. the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes i could taste the detergent they used while wiping or cleaning the bowls spoons or chopsticks with. it throws off the taste but i usually either just switch utensil and itll be fine or ill cleanit down with tea :),Service,,,
Love Dunkin Donuts they provide a big artsy of good ole fashion donuts. Like they should be. I will recommend and return for the yummy donuts and bye the way great real coffee,,,,
Have been here three times due to convenience. Unfortunately convenience does not translate into good food or service. Slow slow slow and the food was not worth the wait. What made it worse last time was watching everyone enjoying their food next door at Otto so much and also knowing that B&B was right beneath us. Third time was not a charm and I will not be going back.,Service,,,
Sushi is yummy. Presentation is great. I never knew we had a great sushi place here near my dingy sherbourne area. Had the red dragon and s11 combo. Warm geen yea. Complementary miso is richyum!,Service,,Value,Location
This is my favourite korean-chineses restarant in Arizona. their food is amazing and service is prompt. I do love Jjampong( spicy seafood noddle) and palbochae and kanpoongki. best dishes ever.!,Service,,,
This sub shop actually gives you real roasted whole meats like smoked ham and roast beef. How many sub shops offer that? They also offer quality breads like pretzel bread. The restaurant itself was quaint and clean and the staff was friendly and efficient. I think this restaurant has excellent potential and is timely with trends toward more natural less processed foods. Overall I really liked it!,,Ambience,,
Came here for lunch with a friend on a Wednesday and the place filled up quickly the tables are situated close together and the place gets very noisy. The waiters were very welcoming as well as quick and attentive. I had their mushroom ravioli and it was freaking delicious. The cream sauce was so amazing that I was eating the bread with it!,Service,Ambience,,
We came in without a reservation and they were able to seat 4 of us immediately. The place is fairly small and filled up while we were there. Food was great as was the service.,Service,Ambience,,
Yeah buddy! Just had Lulu wings and chicken and sausage gumbo with garlic bread for lunch. SO GOOD. THANK YOU!,,,,
Fresh food owner a brilliant chef enthralling to talk to about indian cuisine and spices will be back often...,,Ambience,,
Best Sushi around and much better lunch hibachi than the other local competitors. Definitely recommend!!,,,,
How can any so called mexican rest stop serving salsa. What gives is it to costly. Please let all you customers know about your recent elimination of salsa and chips!Will not be going back,,,,
Great experience dining here. Fast service on a Wednesday afternoon. Server was very attentive and food was great will definitely go back when in the mood for thai food. I even ordered food to go for my son who also liked the food here. The place is very clean,Service,Ambience,,
"Great range of choices for creating your sub. Just hope they get it right.\n\nOf 6 visits in the past 2 months 4 of the orders were wrong. \nAdditionally the ingredient quality seems to be hit and miss.\n\nThe people here are very friendly and always try to make things right but the mistakes have caused me to add this to my ""Only if friends insist"" list.",Service,,,
Not totally authentic Chinese because of Canadian style meat servings. The weekday lunches range from $9-$13 a good value in the Famous Hwy7 Times Square.\nThis cash only small restaurant does not have great ambience but is quite popular with the local crowd. Service is still fast and accurate. Food quality is about average and the servings are large. My ranking for the restaurant is average and on line to be good.,Service,Ambience,Value,Location
This place is terrible. They are always unprepared slow and just unpleasant to do business with. I am an avid starbucks customer and this is the worst location I have ever visited.,Service,,,
"Dear everyone\n\nWe go to this Location almost every Monday. There is a young gentleman named MAURICE. He is so professional and hospitable you""Chipotle"" should feel lucky he is on your team. Every trip is a pleasure to me and my wife and three children. Truly MAURICE is great and lifts the spurt of all the team members working with him. The burritos are always spot on due to the Burrito specialist that are awesome as well. \n\nThanks \n\nPat",Service,,,
Loved this place. Very casual. Huge portions. Very fairly priced. Gets crowded. Will go back,,Ambience,Value,
If you want to feel one of the coolest kids in town this is the place for you. We did family-style for the two of us and it was two veggie dishes chicken and steak and we finish 3.5 of them ( box up some of the chicken for later)!,,Ambience,,
The only Vietnamese place we frequent in Vaughan. Their bun and pho are phenomenal and service is very good. High quality food and eating here is always a pleasure. Highly recommended!,,,,
"Never before in my life have I tasted breakfast this good. The place is small (very small) expect to wait around an hour on the weekends.\n\nOnce you get in here try the ""Hog and Chick"" I suggest you get the hash browns over the potatoes and you MUST MUST MUST try the bacon! (if you\'re a vegan - let it go for one day!) \n\nTheir waffles are to die for too.\n\nAnother 100 places like this and Downtown Phoenix will be THE place to live!!!",,Ambience,,
Ok food. My soda had the wrong proportion of fizz to flavor and the food was somewhat bland. Need more salsa options. Quesadilla was better than the tacos which had very little meat in them.,,,,
Great place .. great coffee ... tasty chicken panini  iced matcha ice latte... next time we will try the darjeeling tea and organic assam tea..which are hard to find :-),,,,
Nope! Go to robertos! Rude food sucks...no thanks..nothing close to robertos! The guy was rude and the restaurant was warm!!,Service,Ambience,,
Great place as always. The meatballs and the pizza are the best!,,,,
"Orderred for a pick up on a Thursday night. Although with just 2 people working theyy managed to prepare the food on time for me. 4-Star because I orderred the ""Com Dac Biet Nhat"" and ""Com Ga Xao Ot."" They were OK... Not an authentic Vietnamese taste but ok. Have not tried their Pho yet!",Service,,,
A Cuban sandwich is understood to be a hot pressed sandwich. I received a cold uncut sandwich on dry white bread. Not pleased.,,,,
The food overall is nothing special we were disappointed in the quality of bacon. The reason I am giving four stars is because the pancakes were to die for. They are not the cakey sicky sweet they are crispy and delicious. I would only recommend glut back for the pancakes. I thought it was a little overpriced for mediocre quality food at breakfast time.,,,Value,
I really like this bakery !! The prices are super friendly and the service is excellent - what else to ask for? Such a nice cozy place that you must try if you live nearby :),Service,Ambience,Value,
"Ugh. A curry dish with barely any veggies? No potatoes do not count. They\'re not green. Even some basil in this so-called ""basil thai"" restaurant would have been nice. Curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor. However given a choice why go and have bad food?",,,,
First time here. Will be coming back. Server was fast and on attentive. He kept our drinks topped off! A must in my book. I got a shreded beef chimichanga. Delicious! Rice had some hard dried out spots like i got the scrapped sides of the pan. My girlfriend got the arroz con pollo. It was ok... Tasted like cambells tomato soup... Overall was good and will be back to try something else!,Service,,,
Simply the BEST! Unbelievable selection of food FRIENDLY staff (love LUPE) fresh fast and a great patio for sitting outside on a beautiful AZ morning. Enjoy!,Service,Ambience,,
Went here on a whim. LOVED IT. The staff was very attentive and the food was great! Loved the whole vibe I got from this place. The price was totally worth the AYCE!,Service,,,
I love this jersey mikes! I often call ahead to order because I am a teacher and when I show up my sandwiches are made and everything is perfect! The workers there are great and always friendly! I suggest the #13 Italian sub but ALL of their subs are awesome! Also if you ask for it with the bread hallowed out it lets you taste the sandwich better!,Service,,,
I just moved out west from Charlotte but Thai Taste was a staple with me and my fianc\xc3\xa9e. We had Thai Taste at least every 2 weeks. My fav dish is the Sweet & Sour w/ fried tofu but I always asked for double tofu because...well who can get enough tofu?\nApps are great there too-favorites are the spring rolls and fresh rolls are really good and the pot stickers are awesome.,,,,
So so good. The kimchi rice and fried chicken are to die for. Only downside is the wait but def worth it. My go to spot for Korean food.,Service,,,
So i ordered food from here tonight worst experience ever i ordered an 18 piece buffalo wings and i got 13 plain wings i also ordered a pizza that was missing toppings and was cold like they had it just sitting there the garlic bread wasnt even toasted like they just took a piece of french bread and slapped some garlic butter on it fries were cold and the zucchini sticks were all mushy will never order food from here again,,,,
Not impressed - the water was unfiltered the food was not authentic or good and the service was not attentive.,Service,,,
First time visit to Pasta La Vista and was really impressed. Party of three all had different entrees and everyone was happy with their meal. The price included bread and soup or salad. Dessert was very good. The prices were reasonable and the service was GREAT. We will definitely be going again.,Service,,Value,
The BEST pizza in Las Vegas PERIOD. Amazing flavorful ingredients and amazing service. They also have a soda machine designed by ferrari that will dispense all the sodas you want. I go back and back and back. This is not your typical pizza joint it is a pizza style from Naples Italy. You will smell the basil and taste the amazing tomato sauce they use. Try it you will not like any other pizza place afterword.,,,,
Nice atmosphere and beautiful setting when you sit outside. Menu changes often but not always for the good. They have gotten rid of a lot of my favorite dishes...pretzel turkey Rueben chicken mozzarella sandwich. Seems like when I find something I like it goes away!,,Ambience,,
New ownership... great friendly environment. Love the wood fired taste and I really LOVE the wood fired Chocolate chip cookies!!,,Ambience,,
Sucks when you the customer know the proper ingredients better than the employees. Guys the veggie burrito comes with guacamole!!,Service,,,
The ice cream and chocolate are both good separately but together the chocolate layer is WAY to thick and quite on the sweet side.,,,,
Good fried chicken tenders and fries. At times I feel the fries outweigh the chicken in quantity but the food is always filling. If you go there for lunch try to go around 11am because the closer you get to 12pm the busier it gets and waiting in line can be a little long.,Service,,,
Great tacos and deals. Churros were great \n! Will come again! Great ace for a quiet date@,,,,
Great food. Ordered a chicken bacon club hot and an Italian sub cold. They were both deliciousness. We watched some sports on the TVs they have. Child friendly environment  polite staff. Recommend to anyone that need a nice sandwich for lunch. Cheers!,Service,Ambience,,
Great place to go for late night happy hour when on Fremont Street. $3 well drinks $3 meatballs and only $7 for their award winning Cal-Italia pizza!,,,Value,
Oysters were fresh ciopino was awesome and large enough for two. Kinda weird eating in a smoke filled noisy environment right on the casino floor. The quality of the meal definitely outweighed the awkward dining area,,Ambience,,
This is my go-to place in the area. I first went here on the recommendation of a local resident and was skeptical when I saw the outside. The food is EXCELLENT. Myself and many of the people I travel with keep hoping we can get sent back to Vegas just to go here!,,,,
This restaurant has the best service and amazing food for the best prices. It is cheaper than panda express but taste like pf changs! Seriously good. They have Chinese doughnuts filled with lotus cream!,Service,,Value,
I love this place. I am not a pizza connoisseur but if I were I am sure this place would be at the top of the list. Their pizza is divine and I am not one to eat crust but here I do because it is not an overpowering clump of dough like in just about every other pizza joint that I have been to. \nDelicious and not too pricey! The Margherita Pizza is to die for.,,,Value,
"I ordered the meatball parm which was listed under ""Dinners"" which states dinners come with garlic bread. I did not get garlic bread I called and was told ""that\'s like the only one that doesnt come with garlic bread""\nAnd i also ordered a side of rigatoni with butter which was $5.50 and i got about 15 noodles.\nSo i paid $14.45 for my meal plus $3.55 tip so $18.00 and got this",,,Value,
Favorite place to get teriyaki chicken! The staff is always super nice and the food is guaranteed delicious! Called in an order for pick up and when I got there about two minutes later they had my food ready for me! Customer service is excellent,Service,,,
mediocre. the food is okay but nothing to rave about. for the price you could definitely find something better. i ordered a shrimp pasta which had tasty homemade (i think) noodles but there were TINY little cut up pieces of shrimp in the pasta. for $18 i think they could have put a few whole shrimp in the dish. kind of lame. they could also use some less expensive wines on the list. probably wont be back.,,,Value,
Not pet friendly at all. Wanted to get my bulldog a puppacino until they asked for me to take him outside before I could even asked. They were quick to assume I was going to stay inside with my dog.,Service,,,
Reasonably good burgers ... very clean environment. Cashier lines get backed quickly. Could improve the order taking by adding additional cashier. Decor doesnt have a theme as other Fuddruckers do. Decent and clean.,Service,Ambience,,
The food here was very standard nothing special or notable on the menu. Servings are large for the price but it takes horrendously long for anything to come out. We had the pork lo mein and found it hearty but bland. Friends have said the same of other options. \n\nTL; DR - mediocre food for super low price after a long wait.,Service,,Value,
This place definitely deserves 5 stars. Very nice and cosy place very friendly staff and relaxing ambiance. I love it! Everything you need in a coffee place. I am not much of a coffee person but i tried their Hawaiian and it is awesomee! I will definitely come to this place when i want to chill and hang out.,Service,Ambience,,
"Have visited a few places from ""Diners Drive-In and Dives"" recommendation and haven\'t been thrilled with the outcome. Not so with this place. Pizza is outrageously good...super light crust and excellent ingredients. The bruschetta is also worth a try. The place is really tiny so if you\'re going on a Friday or Saturday night or during busy lunch hour - be prepared to wait. Even if you live on the east end of town this is worth the drive!",,Ambience,,
AWEFUL I ordered a pesto plate and it was really dry and my husband ordered a sandwich and when it came it out it was really dry. He had to aske for some mayonnaise and mustard and my bread was so dry that I could not even break it with the knife as I was hitting it...... We wanted to order a pizza and were told it would take 45 minutes for it. Well it took us 1 hr and 30 minutes for all of our party to get their orders anyway. When in Mesa I WILL not go back to that Italian place.,Service,,,
Great pizza !! And the giant meatballs were worth coming back for ! A bit slow on the service but overall highly recommended.,Service,,,
We had the spinach pie canzone which was excellent. It oozed cheese great tasting spinach slivers of garlic and plenty of pepperoni in a crispy cust. Highly recommend,,,,
Awful worse then Taco Bell I got a burrito and it was just full of canned nasty beans and tiny bit of meat,,,,
Will change your LIFE! Get there early and be prepared to wait for the best BBQ you will EVER taste!,,,,
This is not meant to be a 5* experience. this is some decent food HUGE variety and great pricing. You can get a plate of biryani for 1.5x the price of a starbucks coffee. think about that,,,Value,
The best Italian restaurant in Toronto. Pizzas are great but the appetizers pastas and other entrees are sensational. When you sit you get great bread and olive oil to munch away. Good beer and wine selection and to finish outstanding tiramisu or other desserts. Well worth the high price.,,,Value,
Their Tandori combo is the Best in Las Vegas tried many Indian restaurant and I keep coming back to India Masala at Riviera hotel is really delicious.,,,,
Food was fantastic with authentic taste however service was terrible ..... I recommend the beef vindaloo ..,Service,,,
Tried this spot for the first time a couple months back and I keep going back because its that good! My favs are the deep fried spring rolls rare beef pho and grilled chickenbeef with rice! So flavorful so good!,,,,
Beautiful decor delicious food. The lamb was tender and well-flavored. Also had the chard starter which is not something I would have ordered had the waiter not recommended it. The flavor and texture reminded me of tabbouleh but with olives added. The food presentation is like that of a Michelen-starred restaurant.,,,,
Super random but super cute friendly and delicious! Service was really great for a busy Sunday morning breakfast! Great find and definitely recommend!,Service,,,
Great food and amazing service I would love to go back and try many of the other dishes they have. Best Sit in Mexican food in Vegas. Highly recommended.,Service,,,
We had dinner here on a Friday afternoon. No customers except for us. It was really hot in there. It seemed like the a/c was off but the fans helped a little. \n\nNo bbq buns on that particular day which was disappointing. The rest of the dimsum items we ordered were ok. We also ordered beef chow fun and fried rice; both very good.\n\nIt took a long long time to get our food. Service was slow but friendly. Might try again.,Service,Ambience,,
I was originally excited about having another new resto in the area. However we just had brunch there today and it was an absolute disappointment. Who is running that place? Service was a gong show food undercook and it took 15 minutes to get a coffee order right. 1st and last time in that joint.,Service,,,
Cavernous Mexican restaurant at the Palms. Anytime I get west of the Mississippi and south of Oklahoma I start hoping for good Mexican food but this was just alright. Good salsa to go with the chips. I was here as part of a large group and it was certainly good for that.,,,,
This continues to be a solid bet on getting great service & great food. Very consistent. And now that season is over as locals we are starting to get back out again. We have always had great friendly fast service & the food is always good.,Service,,,
Great addition to east end of dt. This is one of the best coffee chains in my book. The interior decor is very funky and has an open concept. I love the exposed brick walls with abstract art. It has a very modern Vibe and has a very friendly and open atmosphere. with great staff and fair- priced specialty coffee beverages.,Service,Ambience,Value,
We ate here for the first time tonight. Pretty good...... I think I like Lindo slightly better but they are pretty much the same thing.,,,,
Reminded my of many meals shared with my family overseas. Great flavor and a fair price. Ordered 1 dozen which is enough for two hungry people,,,Value,
Really nice food. A bit pricey but very traditional. Oh did I mention nice food. Awesome,,,Value,
Disappointed when I first came and they ran out of green tea matcha. We instead decided to go with thin mint which was okay. Price is definitely expensive for such a small amount.,,,Value,
YUP!!!\nCan only recall ordering Tacos all night. now let me try this one and this one... oh wait how about that one.. Good Place Good Food Not Cheap good Tequilas on Shelf too!!,,,Value,
They can make a platter GF. Over rice they did change gloves and all. Food quality what is expected from a fast food restaurant. Good to know that in a pinch where no better restaurant available you can eat at a moes.,,,,
the best Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh have to try the omakase which is absolutely deserve 100 bucks! Enjoy it,,,,
I have had my issue with this particular q.t....seriously thought I was gonna boycott. But shit happens and I really do have way more positive things to go off of. Them letting one bad incident hinder my entire perspective. Love this q t have gone here for years and will keep coming for years to come.,Service,,,
The reviews of this Subway were consistently bad. I avoided it for a month then thought that I was being silly. I went into the restaurant and it was perfectly normal. A nice young lady named Ashley made me a very nice foot long spicy Italian sub on Italian herb bread and got me a dozen chocolate chip cookies. She knew how to make the sandwich and delivered it to me in a friendly polite and professional manner. I will be returning tomorrow for another wonderful sub.,Service,,,
Been here before. The food and service is always good. Good home cooking. Wish they had booths. But still ok.,Service,,,
Meh. The main thing that would give me insomnia about this place is the price vs. what you get. Basic cookie with unremarkable taste and texture of being undercooked or over laden with fat. I like chewy but not warm and soggy. I am willing to pay for quality (see previous review) but not mediocrity. I will likely not come back.,,,Value,
Eggs Benedict is AMAZING! Only been here 3 times before my boyfriend has been there so many times in his life they remember him lol,,,,
Good lunch spot. I like that they have a choose two option - so you can get tortilla soup and salad - and it has just a small amount of rice and beans. Perfect serving size for lunch.\n\nYou can also choose two items like a taco and an enchilada - which is also comes in a lunch serving size with small rice and beans. \n\nThe only problem is the chips - why do we have to eat so many chips!!!???,,,,
Love this place! The restaurant is in a kewl old house in downtown Glendale. Pork is bomb chicken pho killer egg rolls and service are great!,,Ambience,,
We were visiting UNC Charlotte and felt like Chinese Food and this place was nearby. Very surprised We ordered 3 main courses and everything was fantastic and so so reasonable. I had soup and the wife and kids had egg rolls and springs rolls and everyone agreed the food was great.,,,,
Pleasantly surprised - I am glad I forgot to read the reviews before I went in. We recently took the vacation of a lifetime (36 foot motor-home from Vegas to St Louis) and stopped by here. The staff was very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the area and the ice cream was fantastic! \nYou guys do a great job - definitely worth stopping by and forming your own opinion. \nAloha and Mahalo \nLanceO,Service,,,
Food is great and sushi well priced for what you get as compared to other local sushi places. Service is decent hence the 4 stars. Otherwise visit and enjoy especially for the sushi lovers.,Service,,Value,
An ok place to get a quick meal if you are really hungry and in a hurry. Beats out all of the other food court fast food by far. The chicken teriyaki with rice is great but everything else is kind of gross out of a cardboard box type food. Simply put only go there if you are in the mood for a large inexpensive portion of really good chicken teriyaki.,,,Value,
Absolutely fantastic. Wish there were more restaurants of this sort in town offering honest friendly and fresh home-cooked meals. \n\nWe tried the Gamja-Tang and the Bibimbap. They were both incredibly flavorful. Unlike many other restaurants we did not leave with a bloated feeling only with the sweet scent of our dishes. The prices were incredibly reasonable as well. A bonus for the complimentary corn tea.,,,Value,
Still an amazing restaurant love how nicely they plate every dish that comes out! Shows that every detail matters in this place :),Service,,,
Great food. Good service. They just need to be able to have separate checks. Seem to have a policy of one check per table,Service,,,
Pizza is pizza right? Wrong!!! This place has amazing Brooklyn style pizza after a nice walk around the strip we walked to New York New York and you can immediately smell pizza. I was kind of hesitant about the place but my wife really wanted to try it. There was 10 min wait for pizza since they get pretty busy. We had Hawaiian slice which was amazing! They had different types and they all looked good. Definitely should check out,Service,,,
Cash only unless above $10 (debit only). We used to go here all the time for their steamed pork buns its adequately stuffed with pork! Lots of selection for sweet cake rolls and bubble tea.,Service,,,
We had an early dinner here on Saturday with friends and family. The service and food were just very below average unfortunately. We are used to attending very good eateries throughout our travels and based on the element and menu -- was very disappointed. I am not a complainer but a moajority of our food came out cold and there was nothing extraordinary about the meals. The server should not be handling large groups of patrons because she was very dissheveled and confused.,Service,,,
I catered this pizza in for an office function a week or so ago without trying it. i did not get to try it at the work function but employees could not say enough great things about it it was obviously a huge hit at the office. so yesterday i decided to give it a try...it was really good and the salad i had too was great. i will certainly be back maybe for lunch during the work week. it is very affordable and a really nice atmosphere in the restaurant.,,,,
Line was long but the service was fast. It took me 15 minutes to reach the front of the line and 2 minutes to get my drink. Then ran to c11 because my flight was paging me. My large ice vanilla latte was worth it!,Service,,,
Service is bad. Waited for the past 10 minutes to get my coffee. Bad work technique. It was a hot mess in there. People asking for their drinks. I walked out of there without my drink. It was so messy & annoying.,Service,,,
great place to get good hearty food. definitely a go to when i want a lot of food.,,,,
When you are in Vegas forget steak and eggs you have to try the Pork Chop and eggs! Served over rice with fish sauce as a side option this is such a great deal. If you want some Pho noodles you will not t be disappointed. The soup base is great and the price is just $8. Highly recommend and better than any vietnamese restaurants i normally eat at in los angeles.,,,Value,
Great pastries and friendly service. A great escape from chain coffee shops.,Service,,,
They are not as good as the reviews. The ramen noodle was too dry the pho was not the authentic Vietnamese pho.,,,,
I love everything about this place! Great beer with great pizza!??!?! DONE AND DONE. They perfected their business model and it shows.,,,,
Went for lunch today - food was good but the service was appalling - the tea was brought out and slid across the table with two cups but not poured the waiter who took the order was disinterested and rude. We over ordered and asked for the left overs to be put into take away containers - the waitress returned with 4 polystyrene containers which she threw onto the table and walked off without a word. Service industry- ha ha!,Service,,,
GreT fast food place in yhe neigjborhood for a quick meal. Enjoy the burritos znd the burgers. However do not recommend the milk shake,,,,
Very reasonable and tasty pizza. They have a lovely thin crust that we really enjoy. The service is really good and the employees are very nice. We try fancier places but always end up back here.,Service,,,
The homemade food never disappoints. The soup and pasta is always amazing! Always ask what the special is because the owner always is trying something new and delicious!,Service,,,
Heard about this place when I vacationing here last month. We decided to come back for the Christmas holiday. This place was AMAZING!!! I especially LOVED my margarita and pastor tacos!! They reminded me of tacos I get from my favorite Taquerio!! Their chips and salsa were good too. I really felt at home listening to Chente and other classics!! I will definitely be coming back before I leave !!,,Ambience,,
Oh how I cant wait to go back here next time I am in AZ. everytime I go to a Mexican restaurant I am always now comparing it to here! The absolute best caldo de res ever!!!! Super nice staff and amazing food!,Service,,,
Love this place. Great customer service. Prices are reasonable. You get a-Lot of food for your dollar. Depending on your dish you order and what your craving the food is good. Some dishes are bland. Overall good for the family especially with the kids. The coffee Ns French toast are deicious,Service,,Value,
A. Sunday afternoon drive brought us here for a real get-away from our small world!\nWonderful view though reflection less glass to pond and waterfall with ducks and turtles delicious house margarita and real tasty Mexican food. A great getaway!,,Ambience,,
The pad thai and green curry are great!,,,,
Drive through was extremely slow considering only 3 cars in front of me plus I ordered a plain black Venti iced coffee and received one with 4 pumps of sweetener.,Service,,,
-friendly employee at the register\n-not too many selections of the frozen yogurt\n-the gummy bears was very very hard! :( - I ended up throwing them.\n-very odd store layout especially you can\'t see the employee when you come in.\n-I hope they play mus,Service,Ambience,,
My dad loves data square and thought it was fantastic! I thought the fudge was wonderful... very sweet like I love it.\n\nThe cupcakes were only average... a little dry.... hence why the overall rating is a 4 not 5!\n\nI live in a different part of Toronto and was shocked that you have to pay for parking EVERYWHERE.,,,,Location
Horrible customer service. No consideration literally just slaps the menu in front of you.,Service,,,
This place have a best service .All the employees always smile. Good customer service.,Service,,,
Nice atmosphere but the food were too salty.. The wait was t worth is and the service was poor,Service,,,
I come to here from Tucson i was starving I stopped here for lunch I was very pleased with my lunch i have the best burrito al pastor they have the best red salsa mmmmm yummy they also bring chips and salsa to your table I definitely will came back money very well spend,,,,
Enjoyed the food at this location better than the one on Queen W. The restaurant is a little more open and has a more familiar feel really cool Mexican memorabilia and decorative staples. Sharing dishes of meat are really good for groups and the Mexican specialty drinks/juices were really great.,,Ambience,,
Made my stomach cramp and hurt all day and night into the next day. All I had was a chicken burrito and chips and queso. It must have been the chicken. The pain started about an hour after eating the food. So grosssssssss,,,,
The sushi here is excellent and service was quick and friendly. If you are a sushi lover this is the place to go! Highly recommend the monkey roll.,Service,,,
Awesome place for ramen. The spicy shoyu is my favorite. Great customer service short wait for your food. I have brought different groups of friends here and most agree that the food is very authentic and delicious. Will be back again and again and again.,Service,,,
We walked in on 11/4 evening and told the blonde haired hostess in the purple shirt we would like some drinks bar was full asked for a table said it was for reservations only. Which is fine however she did not have to have an attitude and sound rude she seemed as if she did not want to serve us at all. This lady needs an attitude adjustment and should not be working in the front! Walked out will not return until you guys train your staff to have a better attitude towards guests!,Service,,,
This is one of my favorite places to eat at has very well cook food as well as very good service my favorite food off the menu is the burrito of steak highly recommended add sour cream,Service,,,
I ate here earlier this evening. Food was not good so they took a few of my items off the bill but I left hungry. I now have food poisoning and I believe it was due to the spinach dip which tasted terrible. If only you could give 0 stars. Never going back to this location.,,,,
AMAZING! A great price for a bounty of delicious food! Ordered my food with UberEATS best idea.,,,,
NOT your run of the mill Asian food!! Well done sauces that ran the gamut from Light (my wife had Naked Garlic dish that was light and slightly sweet) to Spicy (I had a Black Pepper chicken) that had strong flavor (was indicated to be spicy) Just the way I like them. \n\nAdd a little Sake and it was an excellent Dinner. \n\nExcited to see their new space sometime in October just a few miles down the road still on Cave Creek but at Tom Darlington.,,,,
Love the tuna salad sandwich! It is not mayo based so its super light and really great on toasted rye. The people that work there are super sweet which is why I love to support this local business!,Service,,,
The line inside took 20 minutes. Two groups ahead of me in line gave up and walked away without ordering. The only thing that was positive was that they had the pumpkin doughnuts my wife requested. Otherwise the doughnut selections was poor.,Service,,,
Love this place have gone there 4 years remember the father very well sweet great loving had family working there Aunt packed often when they needed an extra hand great fund raisers 2 have really gone global now sold in Giant Eagles  Pgh airports 2 can order on line always great place 2 go,Service,,,
"This pizza was great. Worth the ""Secrecy"". I totally wish they had seating inside (or more seating than 1 bar stool). I probably would have gotten another slice. But by the time I found somewhere to sit I was too far to go back for more!",,Ambience,,
They have delicious Mediterranean food here. The prices are very decent. The staff are super friendly. Will definitely go back!,Service,,Value,
this is absolutely the worst sushi place i have ever been to. Their service is absolutely horrible their staff is rude and their food doesnt taste fresh. Save your money as there are so many other places that are way better.,Service,,,
We stopped here for dinner our first night in Toronto. I had the pineapple salmon and a beer. I thought the food was good and reasonably priced. I would come back again if I was in town as it was an easy walk from the hotel.,,,Value,
Good fresh sliced quality meats and cheese. They also serve Eegees slushes. What could be better?,,,,
Looking for a place to hang with friends? This is the place. Looking to grab a beer and watch the scenery alone? This is the place. Looking to grab something to eat? This is the place. No matter what time my friends and I stop by the bartenders are friendly and the food is good. We have eaten everything from the appetizers to the delicious cheese tortellini (that could rival many of the high priced strip restaurants).,,Ambience,,
One of my favorite places to eat. Literally everything is ridiculously good. Favs are the Bulkogi Salmon Terriyaki Chicken Mac Salad and the Island Wings. Simple yet amazing food.,,,,
So happy to find this place!!! As a native east coaster I have spent the past 8 years looking for good chinese food like back home! Well the search is now over. The food is AWESOME! Tastes like Chinatown back in NYC! Ordering online is so easy and its priced perfect for a quick lunch! Can not wait for the hubby to try!!!,,,,
The donuts are usually pretty good but my berverage order is pretty much always messed up and takes forever to get. Average at best.,Service,,,
My friend and I stepped out for a quick bite to eat. Neither of us were impressed with the quality of the food.,,,,
Have not been here for a while food is still mediocre ordered steak & wedge salad and cob salad both not tasty steak sent back as it was cold chicken on cob salad dry and flavorless . While servers are always nice Service is always bad only customers in whole restaurant and had to get steak sauce on our own as server forgot it.\nManager Tiffany very nice comp meal as it was not that good.,Service,,,
The pizza is always delicious. As a tradition my friend and I come for birthdays because they send a free large pizza coupon if you sign up for their birthday club. We ordered the pepperoni pizza for my friends birthday. And it was amazing.,,,,
"The ""Big Rig"" Pasta calls my name more often than I\'d like. Living close to this much delicious pasta and deep dish pizza is rough on the waist line. Always great service especially outside at the bar.",Service,,,
This is one of the best sushi bars I have ever eaten at. The fish is so fresh and they have AMAZING low carb rolls.,,,,
First time trying this location. Had a question on a new drink I wanted to try but I was quickly brushed off and assumed I ordered. Ended up getting my drink quite quickly only good thing about it. Did not have a chance to properly order my beverage.,Service,,,
Good azzz pizza mmmm tasty. Tomato sauce is nice and sweet  great wings.,,,,
This was an insult to Thai food around the world. My panang curry was melted peanut butter with veggies.,,,,
The pho broth tasted a little watered down but overall not too bad. We were sitting in the corner of the restaurant so we may have been forgotten :(,Service,,,
"Bought four squares today. \n\nHaven\'t been there in a while so hey ! \n\nOpened up the box expecting a taste sweeter than gold \n\nTo my surprise the first two squares were filled with mold. \n\nThrew out the box crying ""Baking fresh things should be #1 and down packed!""\n\nEnding this poem.... I\'ll never be back.",,,,
Pizza slice is thick but the size is small. It does taste delicious but for one person I think you need two. A slice is about $3.50 but really depends what you get. I like the crust because its not oily and at the same time its crunchy. There is a line up outside during lunch time but it moves pretty quick because you order the pizza and they give it to you right a way and you walk to the counter to pay. \n\nIts located in the food court 2nd floor at Bow Valley Square.,Service,,Value,
The nicest owners you could ask for. I came in with an Italian recipe and no clue how to execute it. They talked me through the recipe and how to cook the ingredients. If you want quality italian ingredients and great customer service then look no further. Their sandwiches look amazing too.,Service,,,
Asian Legend food is normally good but not this one. They quality is not even half of the other one.,,,,
Very friendly and nice environment for studying. Relaxing background music as well. Free water and good coffee.,,Ambience,,
I heard great things about this Restaurant. However the food was very greasy and restaurant appeared kind of dirty. Unfortunately I cannot recommend.,,Ambience,,
If you are looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food give this place a try! I ordered a 3 item combination consisting of a flautaenchilada and taco and it was delicious. After checking out I was approached by Juanita the cook and owner to ask about my meal she is truly a great person and I could see that she really wants to provide the best Mexican food possible.,Service,,,
This place is gross. I got the green chili burro and a chili relleno and they were horrible. The green chili burro taste like cat food and relleno was frozen. The only thing that was ok was the salsa and the service. I will never go to macayos again.,Service,,,
We found a bug in our noodles. Disappointing at the handling of the situation. Would not recommend this place for sanity concern.,,,,
O.J. was DELICIOUS! \nFood was yummy. \nService was very polite helpful and efficient. \nLower marks given because they DO NOT have butter in this establishment at all margarine only... blech!\nWhat kind of a breakfast place only has margarine?,Service,,,
Tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mall.\n\nWe were both very disappointed. The food was absolutely terrible. Neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left. \n\nI can in no way recommend this location and suggest going somewhere else.,,,,

Really good basil pesto mayo. I always enjoy the different meats and veggie toppings. Love the fresh ingredients and bread yum!,,,,
Amazing Italian food. The appetizers are amazing as well with the bruschetta bread and meat. Salmon was brain healthy and yummy. Cheesecake is amazing. Direct viet of the Palms Resort from where I am sitting. Definitely an awesome place,,,,

New place and excellent Thai food. Very friendly staff and nice decor. Best in Akron is my vote,Service,Ambience,,
efficient and friendly staff. we tried a few tacos and their pork torta. all excellent. would have to try a few more entrees to see if they qualify for the top tier of mexican restaurants,Service,,,
The only 2 things that stand out for this place is the price and the portion.\n\nThe foods here taste awful. I would rather cook myself a instant noodle and would be more satisfied.,,,Value,
Good fresh food. Ok prices but friendly staff. Crawfish pivot was tasty and fresh. Fried okra was good and fresh.,Service,,,
Hubby and I find ourselves making any excuse to make the 20 minute drive into Charlotte from Huntersville for NJC cappuccino. Fast becoming a Saturday habit. Getting a bite or bread for home at the Local Loaf is a must. Love the fact that all businesses here are local.,,,,

Fast friendly subway standard but they ran out of soup on a cold chilly day and I had to wait in the loooong lunch sandwich line to find out.,,,,
Love their pizza! Eat here a lot! Love the big New York style slices you have to fold to eat.,,,,
We have been going here for years This place has some really good food delicious wings and pizza Have also tried the alfredo very good.,,,,
This place is great!!!!!! They are a small shop and provide personalized service. The kielbasa is the best around and they also make homemade sauerkraut. The smoked slab bacon is amazing. I would highly recommend checking this place out.,Service,,,
I am not sure that I have the words to do justice to my experience with this restaurant tonight.\nIn short it was absolutely fantastic.\nThe name is what initially brought me in with hopes of an Italian family experience I was not disappointed.\nPortions were generous the staff was incredibly friendly and the atmosphere warm.\nTo top it off the food tasted amazing.\nI will definitely be returning.,,,,
This is absolutely the worst pizza i have ever had never again. They shoild be out of business  lil ceasars is way better an that aint sayin much,,,,
This place is in the Santa Fe Resort and Casino. Food was great!! The service was first rate!. The manager was constantly checking on guests to see how the food and service was. The place was super busy and the staff handled the crowd well. The chips and salsa awesome!!!!,Service,,,
The restaurant is in a beat up neighborhood but the inside is cozy. We had the seafood and tofu soup which was alright not as good as other places. We also had the pork wraps and the pork was too sweet and not lean not my favorite. Service was alright. We enjoyed the side dishes though the best part of eating Korean food.,Service,Ambience,,Location
We had a small issue which was promptly resolved by the manager and I absolutely love the food here! Customer service is obviously paramount at this Calgary staple restaurant! Try the dumplings ;),Service,,,
Pizza was very good. It was not over nor undercooked; just perfect. It had good taste and was prepared with quality products. The wings were good. They were well seasoned.

Parking was readily available.,Service,,,Location

This is definitely one of my FAVORITE yogurt places to go whenever I feel depressed. My favorite flavors are cake batter tigers blood and pumpkin pie. Their yogurt always warms my broken heart. I especially like going to this place because one of the employees is so cheery and brings joy to my life !,Service,,,
I am literally addicted to this place! This is the only ramen i will swear by! Iv been coming here for years now and its my favourite place to eat.

The spicy ramen is what first turned me to this place but now the shoyu is my absolute fave! Nothing can compare with this restaurant you will not be disappointed!,Service,,,
Good food but not as good as their other locations. Someone needs to manage the service. Three bad experiences with poor service.,Service,,,

Private parking lot BUT BURGERS PRIEST OPENING NEXT DOOR!!,Service,,,Location
Depending on where in the vegas area you live this place is a must try. Family owned Chicago style pizza as well as many other dishes salads and soups. \n\nRoughly 20 tables family style servings friendly staff.

Fresh and tasty veggies plus lean meat with sauce that is complex and freaking awesome. \n\nThe food is amazing for Chinese but the service will blow your mind. The general manager came out to see how we liked our meal. He even brought out a flower for my wife because mothers day was the next day. \n\nFor fast casual Chinese food this rocks.,Service,,,
Clean fresh ingredients gluten free options. Great place! A bit too liberal with the olive oil but this may have been due to our pizza selections.,,,,

The food has always been good and the servers are always amazing! Its a cool place to hang out but unfortunately is one of the only bars in gilbert so its kind of the only places to go.. and its usually older people.,Service,Ambience,,
Went here for the lunch buffet. Not very good. The food was bland. Most Indian buffets are not very good so my expectations were not very high. I still was hoping very much that this place would be a hidden gem. Unfortunately it was less than satisfactory.,,,,
Took my parents here the other night. It was a wonderful experience. We had bruschetta as an appetizer. Also we had a veggie pizza and for dessert tiramisu. We ordered cappuccinos as well which were amazing! Great service as well. We will return!,Service,,,
Good prices great food. Really enjoyed the lamb kabobs. \nWe had take out so nothing to say about the staff really. The girl on the phone was nice and helpful and the staff was friendly when I paid inside. \nThe inside is nice. Looked clean and well decorated. I would love to eat on their patio sometime. \nWill definitely go again.,Service,Ambience,Value,
"So... you know how the say "" you shouldn\'t judge a book by it\'s cover. Well I judged a place by its name. \n\nVery few Asian eateries I will eat at.. just sayin",,,,
"It was awful....got -2- skinny lattes. Terrible!! No foam and tasted bad....plus a bagel... can we say toasted? ""Oh we don\'t have a toaster!"" Are you kidding!!!!??",,,,
Service for a Saturday night was too slow. We ordered 2 sushi rolls and 2 cokes and waited over 1 hr.,Service,,,
Went there for the first time for dinner 8 of us in total. Restaurant was not busy.The male waiter we had was a smart ass seemed to think he knew everything about how food should be prepared and eaten. My order was 2 skewer lamb kabob platter. All the food arrived at the same time except my lamb was cold and not warm at all. The taste of the food was not bad. Not overly impressed. Spent over $200 will be going somewhere else next time.,Service,,Value,
The people there are extremely rude. Terrible customer service. They take forever even on a non busy day. The manager and waiters refuse to acknowledge you when you call them and the food is overpriced. Would not recommend.,Service,,Value,
Very good food. A varied menu with lots of choices. Mu shu pork and chicken fried rice are our favorites. We pick up and the good preparation is very fast.,Service,,,
This Mr Hero is the best!!!!!! Love the people that run this place. So kind and polite. Recommend everyone to eat here,Service,,,
Very good food very clean and priced fairly. Our second visit was amazing! Our server was very attentive even though they had a full house. The food is very good and priced reasonably. Looking forward to returning soon!,Service,,Value,
Great food and nice staff. My work has recently brought me nearby and I discovered this pizza joint. Everything I have gotten from them pizza or grinder have always been great.,Service,,,
The food was delicious! Lots of flavor and spicy levels were on point. The young men at the front were very nice and friendly even though it was very busy. I had the yellow curry lunch special and was a good size plus you get a soup and an egg roll. The prices were very good as well.,Service,,Value,
First time trying the a la carte menu and pricing was very reasonable! \n\nOrder two chicken run rolls and a yam tempura (total of 18 pics) and it came to $16.\n\nStaff was also very friendly and food came quickly.,Service,,Value,
What a cool hip place to go eat. Pizza was amazing. Zucchini Fries made a great appetizer and their chopped salad was perfection.,,Ambience,,
Worst Biryani I ever tasted...wasted of 50 bucks as I bought family size combo. One star because this is lowest rating I can give. Dirty place most likely hygiene issues employees were not very professional either. I strongly recommend to avoid this place to save your money and health.,Service,Ambience,Value,
Very good pizza....so much fresher than the chains. Service is quick and friendly. Now if they just had online ordering...,Service,,,
I think this is some of the best ice cream around. Jeni not only supports local businesses but she is conscientious and cares a lot about sourcing the highest quality ingredients. Her ice cream is exquisite.,Service,,,
Best garnacha place that it has food from Mexico City. Everything is delicious.\nMy favorite disches: Quesadillas Pozole Chilaquiles and Guarache\nSpace is little.,,Ambience,,
My wife and I where near Arrowhead Mall on a day of shopping. We wanted something different for lunch and stopped into Red Devil.\n\nThe food was excellent and it was not crowded. Understand going in that this is not a sit down and order place. Like Pei Wei and many other chains in the valley you place your order in advance and then find a seat. The food was delivered quickly and as ordered. \n\nWe will make a return visit next time we are near the mall.,Service,Ambience,,
Best pizza ever! Definitely need more credit for their amazing customer service and food!,Service,,,
Girasole has provided a great spot to meet up for lunch for several years. I love their signature salad! The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I love this place!,Service,Ambience,,
Red Orchid has some of the best Thai. My wife and I have eaten there numerous times and have tried many dishes. Each one was exceptional. We highly recommend this restaurant!,,,,
Best pizza in the neighborhood. Always fresh and very generous toppings. Deals are great. $11.29 for a medium pizza. You can ask for different type of crust and half-half topping combinations. They are pretty flexible on that.,Service,,Value,
Cheap but the food is very low quality. Comparable to a golden corral or hometown buffet with a bigger selection. Personally i would rank this buffet below anything on the strip but its popular with locals for obvious reasons.\nBottom line if you want to eat like a slob for cheap and dont mind 3/10 quality food eat here.,,,Value,
My husband and I decided to try this place despite the reviews. We ordered a small meat pizza and a combo calzone. Our pizza was so good! It was crispy and had enough toppings. \nThe calzone was bigger than we thought my husband tried it and he said it was good. We had to take the calzone home because we were full. \nThey also serve beer!\n\nThe gentleman that helped us was nice. He made our order from scratch. The place is nice and clean!\n\nWe will definitely give this place another visit.,Service,Ambience,,
Best airport coffee in the united States. And Yes I have been to Seattle. The White Zombie is triple the caffeine. Without going to Hawaii this is it.,,,,
I eat in and out at least three times a week. I am not saying this is good or healthy but I do eat at multiple ones across the valley. The one in Tempe by the 202 at Scottsdale Road does not and apparently cannot keep up like the other ones. Drive-through time is always longer with the same amount of cars and I know because in and out lines are long and it is popular.\n\nBut....if All the other locations can handle it why can this one not??,Service,,,
"Painfully dull food. Sorry. There are way better Italian places nearby. Try Marco\'s on 116th. Or Sal\'s or Tesoro. The calamari was OK the meat/cheese plate OK also. The chicken I had with ""hot sausage"" so bland you could have fed it to a toddler. Same with my husband\'s veal dish and the salmon. The valley is bad enough Fountain hills is worse for food. I had hopes. All these glowing reviews just shows show low the standards are here.",,,,
We were excited to try this pizza since we read so many good reviews. The pizza was disappointing and I think over priced at $30 per pizza. There is barely any cheese to speak of making this more like bread with tomato sauce and toppings. The crust was crisp which was nice. The next day I put 8 oz of mozzarella cheese on the half of pizza we had leftover which made it better but we will not be going back.,,,Value,
Liked it. On a busy Saturday morning food took like 2 minutes. Home fries could use more spices. The truly fresh orange juice is delicious; the $4 it cost me was worth it. Addictive. Service was fine but without those fake smiles that are becoming the norm in some places and which only show the level of desperation of the customer service people to keep their jobs. Honest good food. Period.,Service,,Value,
Service is good. Fast. Nice. Food is good. Quality is good. Favorites. Hawaiian pork belly smoked garlic pork belly. Mashed potatoes.,Service,,,
"In Vegas with a few friends and we\'re about to embark on our long journey back to Southern California my friend is like ""okay let\'s find a cheap gas station"" well whaaaaala! Here we are at this Speedee Mart conveniently located down the street from China Town and the Las Vegas strip gas is fairly cheap here but the area just seem so darn sketch for being so fairly close to tourist activities! We get gas and leave I probably wouldn\'t come here by myself or even at night!",,,Value,Location
As a chef from being able to order the temperature of my eggs in the eggs Benedict freshly ground Sumatra coffee every morning 3 different types of hot sauces and ketchup made fresh to home made chocolate cheesecake pumpkin butter watermelon jelly jalape\xc3\xb1o jelly in Miami where i am from i have to pay fucking 28 dollars for a meal like this. Martha was the best server! So so happy we found this place.,Service,,,
This is the second time I ate here and again it was amazing. We had the all you can eat option and they pretty much ate till it hurt. The fish was fresh and the rice to fish ratio was on point. If you like sushi this is definitely the place to eat.,,,,
I love Port of Subs generally but this Windmill and Pecos stands out as exceptional. MIGUEL and TONY shine. They are models of customer service excellence and make every one of my visits special. And they keep a sparkling clean restaurant and sandwich prep line. Thank you for the gracious upbeat service guys!,Service,Ambience,,
Three meals so far each one has been spot on. Sit at the bar top and you might get a front row show to the noodles being made. Try the make it yourself tuna hand rolls. All of the noodle dishes are superb so go with what sounds good.,,Ambience,,
The pasta is fresh and the pizza dough is airy and light. Wonderful and delicious food. Will definitely be returning.,,,,
This is the better Red Devil that Ive been to.\n\nLove the bistro type set up it lends a more casual atmosphere than other Red Devils.\n\nAnd of course the food was fabulous.,,Ambience,,
I went here to try the snicker ice cream milk shake because I never had that flavor. When I got there on May 17 2017 the staff told me that they did not have any ice creamy. All they had was gelatos. I never had a gelato milkshake. I told the staff if they could make an cookies and cream milkshake. They did. It was good but I prefer cookies and cream ice cream milkshake.,Service,,,
Super clean nice place to have a meal... Home made chinese Mustard.\nLiked the appetizer combo very much. Egg foo young is the best I have had in years & years. Great value nice sized portions. Staff is attentive and friendly.,Service,Ambience,Value,
Excellent meal. All curries were great. Shrimp satay fantastic. Highly recommend. Make a reservation gets busy.,,,,
Horrible customer service!! Called at 12 to have 2 sandwiches delivered to my work. Called back at 12:50 to cancel since my lunch was over not only did I get an attitude from an employee AND the manager they hung up on me. Delivery guy showed up at 1:10 after I already canceled the order and could get my lunch since it was over 20 min prior. So upset. Never ordering from there again,Service,,,
Really nice for cheap korean snack food! \nGood prices good service well prepared food.\nIf you want to test the waters with korean food GaNaDaRa has a good selection to choose from,Service,,Value,
I love this place. I usually get their lunch boxes. Nice creations & friendly staff.,Service,,,
Coffee roasted in-house and a relaxed atmosphere to enjoy it; who could ask for more?,,Ambience,,
Came for a birthday breakfast and left extremely happy and satisfied!! Our server was friendly and checked on us multiple times to make sure everything was going well. Had empanadas made of platanos for dessert. Yummy!,Service,,,
Ah Daily Scoop. One of the many reasons why I love Madison so much. \n\nThese guys are one of a select few that actually know what good ice cream is. Many attempt and many fail but these guys do not. They know their stuff.\n\nDaily Scoop ice cream is quality. Such rich & creamy deliciousness!\n\nThe chocolate peanut butter and coffee-caramel-chocolate flavors are wondrous.\n\nPlus they give you a great amount for the price you pay.\n\nThis is the real deal.,,,Value,
Yummy Gelato 72 flavours Strawberry Crape excellent services fresh coffee! International candies some I have not that seen since you were a kid. Great family business!,,,,
Kids loved the pick your own toppings and seeing the pizza on its way to the oven. The double dough though!!! Sooo good!! Perfect family lunch/dinner.,Service,,,
Overpriced for basic pasta dishes and pizza.\nCouple that with the owners speaking mostly to people they know and well its certainly nothing to write home about...,Service,,Value,
This place was okay the fold was good but the place had a bad smell I would expect them to keep it a little cleaner overall I would go back if the smell went away .,,Ambience,,
This was highly recommended by the hotel over the closer ones. I should have went to one of the other ones I inquired about. Food was average. Limited menu. Very few vegetables were served. Soup was bland and fried rice was horrible! Salad was ok. Nice chef and waitress. Good portion of shrimp. OK steak but thin chicken. Wouldnt accept entertainment mobile coupon that the site said they take. They expected me to have a mobile printer in my car.,Service,,,
Been eating here for years usually about 2x/ month. Food is always good. Efficient fast service they can go thru a line that is to the front door very quickly. Only complaint is the cost of their guacamole.,Service,,Value,
I ordered the El Gaucho and could not stop eating it. The steak was really tender and the chimichurri and caramelized onions were so flavorful (not spicy) plus the salad on top makes it seem almost healthy!,,,,
Good prices good food good service...the late night happy hour times can be busy! The Oxtail soup is pretty darn good. I also had the steak and eggs no complaints! And by the way considering how busy this place gets the service was just fine.,Service,,Value,
Food **** - Service ***** - ambience ****\n\nWe ordered the vegetarian Pizza and a veggie pasta in white wine lemon sauce. I must the say the pizza was really delicious. The pizza bread was quite tasty & the tomato sauce used in the pizza was really delicious. \n\nThe pasta however was only a 2.5/5. The penne was dry and did not taste as awesome as the pizza did. \n\nThe service was good. Very inviting and responsive waiter. I felt good giving him a good tip. \n\nCertainly recommend this place.,Service,Ambience,,
Really good Thai food at an affordable price. Only downside is that the chicken is rather dry in their Tom Kha soup. Otherwise everything is good.,,,Value,
Soupy pasta sauce very unremarkable house salad. Not great atmosphere in a little strip mall Would not return.,,Ambience,,
Stayed at the Sheraton just down the street and walked here for a late breakfast after check out. The service was really great from the waitress I had and my omelette was tasty. Not much else to ask for.\n\nA no-frills kinda diner open 24-hours with good food is a valuable resource in any city.,Service,Ambience,,
Nice ambiance. Happy to learn that they only serve fish that population wise is not threatened (they have sustainable seafood standards) and it comes from the wild (farm raised fish require catching wild fish to feed them=bad). Food was decent but for their sustainability efforts I would return.,,Ambience,,
My burrito looks like a baked potato The veggies that were $1.00 extra were dry in pans. Disappointed,,,Value,
I love love love this place! Great prices and a good variety. I shop here for a lot of my produce. They have a great selection. They also have a good selection of veggie meat substitutes! The only negatives are narrow parking spaces and sometimes some of the produce can be wilty. But overall I love this place!,,,Value,Location
"I had a good experience here. Our waitress was super nice. The food was pretty darn good too. Out of 4 meals everyone liked what they got...the ""awesome"" roast beef sandwich cheeseburger shrimp and grits and one of the fish entrees. The cornbread app was yummy too. Oh and the lemonade is fresh. I give it 4 stars because while very good it didn\'t make me think about my next trip back. I\'m sure I\'ll be back at some point but I might try out a few other places first.",Service,,,
I have eaten here many times as well as gotten them to cater two events with about 80 and 60 attendees. Each time I was completely satisfied. Authentic Indian taste each time. Not overly cooked or colored just perfect. I love their Paneer/Chicken Tikka Masala. You wont go wrong with them.,Service,,,
Cozy little spot. Nice location. Never too crowded. Service is always nice and friendly. AYCE sushi is at a great price. My families favorite spot. Great date restaurant.,Service,Ambience,Value,
The place was filthy! My drink was not consistent with what I normally receive when I order it. I was very disappointed.,,,Value,
Amazing!!!! Above and beyond customer service authentic mexican food. Best hidden secret,Service,,,
Very good. We have usually gone to the place in Cornelius but this place was much better. The only think I still do not like is the way they serve you spaghetti as noodles. I will-never understand that. How expensive can doodles be? We had a nice young man who was out server and he was very pleasant. . The food was very tasty and loved the yelp bonus,Service,,,
"I won\'t be back. We were actually approached by staff while finishing our coffee and asked to leave because "" they had no customers and were going to close early"". I\'ll be more than willing to assist them to close.",Service,,,
Mmmmmm.....some tasty Persian food near Trinity Bellwoods. Koobideh is delicious ash-e-reshteh is amazing chicken barley soup is for real and the mirzeh ghasemi is smoky goodness. Love it!,,,,
5 stars for the fact that it was reasonably priced for all you an eat sushi. \n\n3 stars for the staffing who seemed uninterested and needed a calculator for 151 - 100\n\n3 stars for decor ( the umbrellas from the ceiling very cool )\n\nFavorate roll: Crunchy Philly Roll,Service,Ambience,Value,
Great dough and high quality toppings. This is definitely our go to pizza place in the Gilbert area.,,,,
I grew up going to Los Olivos. Miss it so. Especially the cheese crisps. My favorite Mexican restaurant ever.,,,,
There pizza is alot better than the other chain stores nice atmosphere stone oven makes the best tasting pizza,,Ambience,,
The best kept secret in the area! They have the best tacos and the carnitas is unreal. Everything from the rice to the guacamole to the quesadillas is amazing. I get my fix from here at least twice a month sometimes once a week. The hours are a little different so just check and make sure they are open!,Service,,,
Went for happy hour. Food and drinks were very good for the price. Bartenders were very friendly.,Service,,Value,
Great food OK service. Consistently teriffic food. Exohico was wonderful. Grilled calamari was excellent. Saganaki a big hit. Agreed with another reviewer that the bread was not great. A little noisy on Saturday night. Hard to have a conversation.,Service,Ambience,,
The staff are knowledgeable friendly and outgoing even at the most difficult of occasions (busy periods rushes difficult customers). They have local Ontario grown produce and product information at the ready and offer a good variety of grocery basics. The continuity of the staff over time is a sign of good management and to loyal customers this means familiar faces and a relationships of trust.,Service,,,
OMG... what a great place. They have all kinds of cool bread dessert pastry cookies etc. I was a little over loaded. I bought a tiarimisu and a apple turnover.,,,,
Awesome donuts!!!!! Flavor and quality is second to none. Sweet potato is awesome. Apple pie fritter is best I have ever had and for a true sin the cronut!!!! Get em at 9am everyday. They are so freaking good!!!,,,,
Stumbled upon this place looking for breakfast on our trip to Montreal. We loved it!! What a delicious grilled cheese! It was a lovely surprise! One of my best breakfasts on my trip to Montreal!,,,,
The 49er flapjacks are something special. The extra thick bacon is wonderful and always cooked as it should be.,,,,
Very slow service but Tony compensated with free tea and bruschetta he was very helpfull,Service,,,
Delicious smoothies. So fresh and great tasting. Must visit!,,,,
Amazing food was delicious and the service was great by rosa very helpful and also the food was amazing!!! Should absolutely try!! Coming back for sure!!,Service,,,
One more recent Phoenix landmark to knock off my checklist. Nice open social space. Good attention to detail by wait staff. My Osso Bucco and spaetzle meal was proof that Germans and Italians can create great things together. In spite of the length of my restaurant to-do list I will make sure that this place gets more visits.\n\nAnd yes the parking lot does suck.,,Ambience,,Location
Walked in and found a large group around the bar. Went to get a beer and was told that it is closed now for general business and in the indefinite future to anything but private gatherings. Looks as though they overbuilt in an area without the necessary nightlife to be a bar at the moment and possibly concentrating on bottling.,Service,,,
We have been to this location many times food is consistently delicious and serivce is always good. Unfortunately their other location (DC Ranch) has a problem with service and getting the orders correct.,Service,,,
Wow. Amazing meal. Read the reviews 1st and they were spot on! Do not miss the meatball and fried mozzarella appetizer and the egg plant app! We were getting full so we split the Rigatoni Sunday Pork and it was AMAZING!!!! Do not miss these 3 dishes. Our Bartender Evis recommended it and he was spot on. Had an wonderful glass of wine with it! We will be back every time we visit Vegas!,Service,,,
This was my 2nd time here but this is my first review. The pho as always is delicious and the spring rolls with peanut sauce was a meal within itself.,,,,
My favourite kabob place! The meat is so juicy and tender! Cheap food as well if you order the dinner plate the portion is so big that I have to take some of it home.\n\nI recommend Chaplee dinner plate my all time favourite,,,,
Just went here to sample the guac and I definitely want to go back and try more of the menu! We got three different kinds of guacamole! Goat cheese pineapple crab. Yum! The cucumber margarita was a let down though.,,,,
Once you get your expectations in order you realize that this is a good and reasonably priced meal in a historic and cool part of Tempe. Their bread is excellent.,,,Value,
Fantastic place. I think the place is privately owned. Details matter when they put out your dish. Food is consistently good and healthy with very little wait.\n\nChicken souvlaki with rice and salad is our regular choice.,,,,
Easily the best fries I have ever eaten and the chicken was just incredible. I ordered the meal with 1/4 thighs. The salad and dressing were fantastic as well. Extremely cheap I shared one order with a friend and were were both quite full but even if I had ordered a meal for myself the prices were dirt-cheap.,,,Value,
Food here is way better than most local Hawaiian bbq restaurants including l&l I strongly suggest trying it out. I just happened to be driving but hungry asf,,,,
My son 1st introduced me to kaizen & it has rapidly become my go to place for sushi! With the fun personalities of the chefs and their creative flare this is a place that never disappoints whether it is a business dinner or a casual night out with the hubby! Another bonus is it is close to home and the price is right if you love to eat!,Service,Ambience,Value,
Me and my girlfriend went today and our waiter was worried about everybody else besides us and the food was terrible,Service,,,
This place is awesome and is now in Mississauga. I use to always get Heritage fish and chips when I was working in Brampton. The lunch special is huge and the fish is cooked to perfection. I eat here at least 2-3 a month and have not been disappointed.,,,,
Location is super convenient and staff here are great.\n\nThe Starbucks located at Queen and Victoria is tiny with very limited seating. They do have booth seating for two which makes it a great place for studying or dates if you can find an unoccupied one.,Service,Ambience,,Location
Excellent food and very clean establishment. A great value as well  would definitely recommend.,,Ambience,Value,
My favourite go-to place. The staff are so friendly there and they have a good variety of ice cream there. I absolutely love the blueberry cheesecake there.,Service,,,
Service was fast and friendly on a Sunday lunch. Chips and salsa were good. Homemade salsa had a nice kick. Had the combo enchilada suizas. Came out fast and hot. All good. Waitress checked back often to see if I was happy. \n\nAll a great deal for a $13 lunch with beer and tax! \n\nWould love to see the bar going. Looks like a hopping place for later.,Service,,Value,
I am giving this place one star - for leaving 4 menus on my door and floor in the condo building I live in - I would think 1 menu would be enough not that I wanted it...,,,,
Absolutely amazing pizza! Tried the Honey Pork Belly and the Carnivore. Welcome to Main St Markham! About time we had a top notch gourmet pizza place.,,,,
This place is deelish. When in Vegas venture off the strip and make your way here def worth it!,,,,
I love Yogurtland and this location is pretty good. They have lots of flavors and toppings. It can get crowded at night and they seem to run out of some flavors which can be sort of annoying. If you use your frequent buyer card or whatever though you can get your froyo for a super good price.,,Ambience,Value,
Good price. Very quaint. Beautiful inside. Good chips and salsa. Good portions. Not a big fan of the burritos though. I have been here multiple times since my first review and I get their chimichangas. They are amazing. Usually I get ground beef which seems to be the most tasty option. Make sure to get beans and rice on the side.,,Ambience,,
Sushi was great quality and service felt top notch. The server was very attentive and followed up to ensure satisfaction. We tried 2 specialty sushi rolls - both delicious. It helped that sauce was presented on the side so you can choose how much. I would recommend and visit again!,Service,,,
Yummy coffee drinks! First time here asked for a specials combo of almond milk cold brew coffee & the barista said sure & made a tasty drink. The coffee was smooth & bold. Nice chairs but I was on the go so I will return to try the foods. Only wish they had more parking. (Tip-I went down the street to park & walked back to it.),,,,Location
Great service and great food the 2 times I have been in! I have the chicken and my wife has the shrimp. We will certainly be back. So glad to have this restaurant in the neighborhood.,Service,,,
My favourite Asian fast-food restaurant. I love the staff that works here. They always have a smile on their faces and that provides me with a sense of warmth. The food is really warm too! My favourite dishes are Pad Thai and Fried Rice. There was one time my food was too salty they gave me a new one forthwith!,Service,,,
They have a Saturday BBQ deal that is fantastic!!! Been there a couple of times and loved it!,,,,
Love Krispy Kreme but I do not like this location...it has only been open a short while and already the floor behind the counter is filthy. No free glazed as you wait for service...understaffed and no atmosphere makes this a take away spot...,Service,Ambience,,
UPDATE\n\nChanging from 1 Star to 3. My daughter brought me a Carnitas Burrito from the restaurant. Quality has returned I do not know about the service so that is why I only upgraded to 3 stars. \n\nCold food no flavor and lousy service have turned a good restaurant into a poor one. I will not be back especially after I was told they would not fix the burrito. Stay away folks,Service,,,
Ice cream is always welcome in summer.. But just chocolat and vanilla ice cream with many many choices of Chocolat dip . I really appreciate that they have the mini size option for ice cream. There is also a little terrasse available.,,Ambience,,
This place has fantastic veal and chicken sandwiches; the portions are huge and the tomato sauce they use is delicious! The olives are great too:),,,,
Howzit!?\n\nAverage food. Good atmosphere. Great service.\n\nKids and baby friendly with changing station and designated stroller parking area. Also a complimentary dish for kids.\n\nNotable dish: French Onion Soup.,Service,Ambience,,
Best New York style pizza in the area and the staff is very friendly. They have a lot of options to choose from as well.,Service,,,
Fried rice was worst i ever eat...im grow up asia and i go out eat some other place around here but this is worst place.\nAnd service people are not so good little rude.\nIm so disappointed. . . .,Service,,,
Dear Galaxie Diner\nI miss you so much. Your ewy gewy melted goodness and unlimited hashbrowns. You were my best friend the 2 years i spent in Calgary. Could you please open one in Vancouver.. i will be an investor. \nBest\nVanessa,,,,
Great Mexican food! Fresh and hot! The chips are delicious as well. Service was very kind and fast.,Service,,,
Hands down the best shrimp and fish tacos around. I ordered the 3 tacos mixed it up with 2 shrimp and 1 fish. The fish taco was a huge fillet and cooked to perfection. This is your place if you like authentic tacos!,,,,
Everything was made on the premises & you can really tell the difference! Excellent mini muffins (zucchini & pumpkin are my favs!) & really enjoyed the Garden Eggs Benedict (with mushrooms & spinach)! Country potatoes were very good too!,,,,
We went here for dinner with some friends. I recommend sitting outside. The server was very pleasant helpful and communicated well. The wine was very good. The food was good nothing special about it. Overall we might go back we might not. It was a good experience but the prices are high so not a place you would go to often.,Service,Ambience,Value,
Crust is the best part. Toppings are minimal. Sauce is bland with very little flavor. Nothing like good NY pie.,,,,
Be careful when ordering food to go ordered takeout after work and it took about 45 minutes to get 3 tiny dishes. They really need to work on their customer service and speed. Food was ok nothing that special I think that The Fry is better. It was super pricey.,Service,,,
In the young naive days before I discovered the joy of gyros this place was just a late night grub and Greek mafia money laundering joint. Rooftop patio which was cool (but not in the winter when it would have been *very* cool).,,Ambience,,
No no no!!!!! Had such high hopes for this place since it was close to home. Why are reviews so high? Their curry is thin and watery and all my dishes literally had no flavor. They are devoid of any taste or spices. Panda Express is disgusting and yet I think I would have had a better experience there. Run people!!!,,,,
"The lady at the counter was very short and rude. Almost like my questions were bothering her. The sign in the lobby says ""save some pesos"" that shouldn\'t be the slogan because they charged me $5 for chips and salsa after I paid $36 for a take out order. On top of that refills on fountain drinks cost 25 cents. Next thing you know it will cost $2 to use the restroom there. I would recommend Rubio\'s as a way better alternative. One and done with this place!!! Never again!",Service,,Value,
Still just as good as ever. I would fly to Vegas just to eat their milkshakes. Waffle fries are good too.,,,,
The food was delicious and FRESH! Service was also excellent the waitress really took care of us. \n\nWe decided on one of the roll trays (40 PCS) which included the California Roll Salmon Roll Shrimp Tempura Roll Black Dragon Roll Orange Dragon Roll and the Spicy Caterpillar Roll (which was definitely our favourite and a must try!)\n\nIf you are in the area you should definitely check this place out. The food looks incredibly appetizing and will not disappoint!,Service,,,
I find their drive thru really convenient but the inside is comfortable as well. My wife enjoys the taco salad and chimichangas. I get 5 rolled tacos with carne asada or the sopes. My favorite place in Goodyear,,Ambience,,
Great diner fare (breakfast and sandwiches); BBQ is also good but priced high. We have been going there a few times a month for years (going back to the original location on 5th Ave) and the food and service has been consistently good.\n\nVery highly recommended!,Service,,Value,
Nick promote Cathy and Philip. They both have amazing customer service. I know you guys are super busy but when you get a chance please double their salary promote them or at least give them a gold star. God bless!\n\n-Jake the film guy,Service,,,
The service and food was exceptional. We came here after our best friend purchased her wedding dress to celebrate and the staff was incredibly accommodating and made the experience so special for us. Highly recommended!!,Service,,,
Always good always fresh. Love me some Chipotle. Will get full-size quesadilla for kid next time instead of kids meal one.,,,,
Bunch of cheats. Went there Sunday evening and ordered a couple of items upto 15$. After reaching home realized that at the store they forgot to include one of the items I had ordered for. Will never go back here again and neither to their sister property Chettinaad something. A real bunch of Indian cheats. Being Indian myself I feel he just tried to rip me off and succeeded. Do I need to open the packet and check everything that I ordered? Bunch of scoundrels.,Service,,Value,
I dropped by this place with two friends one day randomly as we were walking down Yonge. \n\nThe decor was nice so we went for it. When we ordered we realized that the dumplings were quite small and as such had to order quite a few dishes. The shrimp was really good but most of the meat was mediocre at best. Overall we ended up with a bill close to $100. With tips we ended up playing $35+ per person and to be honest it was not worth it. I have had better Dim Sum at much better prices.,,Ambience,Value,
Rude staff no manager present. I am the customer. I pay your bills. You are serving me. Act like you care a tiny bit,Service,,,
Super perky for so early!!! Thomas took my order and the young lady had it ready (3 different drinks) in less than five minutes!!! Awesome place!!!,Service,,,
I do like this place a lot. Its across the street and is always there whenever my stomach is in the mood for some spicy Lo Mein (you have to ask for it Spicy but its delicious if you do)\n\nMy GF and her daughter love the place as well and always fight over the leftovers they have.\n\nWe will be back and who knows I may just try something other than their Lo Mein.,,,,
Just picked up a to go order. Fast and delicious. I had the green chile enchiladas my kids had the chicken with rice and beans and the steak rice and beans kids plate. We all gobbled it up. So good. We will be back.,Service,,,
This was my most favorite ramen place in Vegas! It breaks my heart to find out this place closed down. ;_;,,,,
I just popped in here for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. This cute little coffee shop serves deliciously fresh coffee!,Service,,,
"I stop at a Starbucks location everyday and wanted to check out this store on my way to work. I walked up said good morning asked the older blonde barista how she was doing and she didn\'t even smile when she cut me off ""What can I get you..."" Everyone in this store seemed like they were irritable and hadn\'t had their coffee yet this morning. Sorry to say that I won\'t be stopping here again.",Service,,,
The rating is specific to this location. If you plan on not getting what you ordered and not one person to care.. go here!!,Service,,,
Their tamarind pad thai are amazing! must try if you want some good tasting noodles! However the prices are a bit steep. $13 incl tax for one. Portions are sometimes big sometimes smaller,,,Value,
Slowest service of any chipotle I have been to. Looked like there was plenty of staff available. Line was out the door at 2:00pm.,Service,,,
Terrible service! After ~10 minutes and 3 staff checking on other patio tables we left.,Service,,,
This is my favorite Vienamese Restaurant. I have been a fan for a couple years already. I order fresh spring rolls grilled dish vermicelli. Service is always fantastic. Huge servings. The owner is always around it is also clean.,Service,Ambience,,
We returned here last night; it has been a regular spot since we moved to the area 4 years ago.\n\nThe pizza combinations they offer are creative and delicious. The oven-baked thin crusts are delicious. The ingredients are always fresh. Many of the pizzas feature fresh herbs. The service is always prompt and friendly. It is a fun place to be and the food is excellent.,Service,,,
I really like this papa johns! They are so quick with delivery it is great! And the pizza is always good! One time we had pizza delivered and they forgot to cut it so I called back and asked if we could bring it in to be cut but instead they brought us a new one completely free and cut our old one!!! Great customer service!!!,Service,,,
Came in to get some stuff for my moms birthday and I had a hard time deciding because there was so much to choose from. The prices are reasonable and the owner was super friendly! This will definitely not be the last time I visit!!!,Service,,Value,
My favorite part of the morning!! Stop in daily all the employees are friendly they make an effort to get to know your name and your regular purchase.,Service,,,
OK is really what this place is...The cooks look dirty the place looks greasy on the bright side the girl is friendly at the counter...The food is ok...Take a good look behind the counter where the food is being prepped...Even wearing Sandals...Gross...,Service,Ambience,,
This place is absolutely amazing!! The almond latte is the best I have ever had. Their biscotti is soo addictive. Everything is fresh and just super yummy. An Italian cafe gem hidden in the downtown core,,,,Location
Great food and friendly atmosphere. Definitely putting this on the list of places to go.,,Ambience,,
The gobernator (smoked marlin and shrimp) taco was disappointing.,,,,
What a great environment. The atmosphere here is so calming. I really enjoy thier coffee but even more so the fun things they have for sale all over the cafe.\n\nIts well decorated with unique items coffee and tea lovers would truly enjoy.\n& the service!? Amazing. Seriously friendly individuals who really care for threir guests needs.\nWrap all of that up with free wifi and you have a spot worth working out of.,Service,Ambience,,
Great beer and very friendly employees love the atmosphere. A sweet place in general to grab a brew after work. \nHave a lot of respect for a young guy venturing in to the already saturated beer market and creating some amazing tasting drinks.\n\nSweet historical photos on the wall of their location that used to be a used to rig oil.,Service,Ambience,,
Had the buffet. Everything was fresh and tasty. Even hubby who was reluctant to try the food enjoyed all he ate.,,,,
The food is pretty good but the sushi is huge and piled with so much stuff it all tastes the same. The service was so so as well.,Service,,,
Tried this for the first time based on reviews on Yelp. I usually get my chicken roti in Brampton at Alimas but this Roti blows them out of the water. A little more expensive but a whole lot bigger and tastier. Hands down the best Roti anywhere.,,,Value,
Love this place. I decided to come here after my host booked me in for a 150$ dining credit here. So we then proceed walked in was seated very quickly. Then I notice the ambience of this place is really nice . I ordered the burger and my wife ordered the chicken . For appetizer we ordered crab cakes. Overall the food taste great servers were attentive. Definitely would be coming back.,Service,Ambience,,
Excellent sushi. I loved everything I ordered but I would definitely say their sushi is VERY fresh and well prepared. I felt like the fish melted in my mouth. The coctails and desert were also very good. If anyone is in Vegas and wanting to eat good Japanese food this is the place. A bit pricey but worth it. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the waiter was not the most informative nor friendliest. I will be going back here when I am in Vegas again.,Service,,Value,
Decent New York style pizza right on the strip. A little bit hard to find but tucked in next to the Planet Hollywood casino.\nVery small place with just a counter to order and a standing bar to eat. No tables or seating.\nGood prices. I had a huge slice of pizza bread knot and soda for about 10 dollars. Plenty to fill you up.,,Ambience,Value,
This was our first meal together when we moved here little bit over a year ago. Yes! We ordered pizza! I have always liked Pizza Hut but this was a bad experience! Pizza was just plain not much flavor? And we had to pay for it that evening to the next day!!! Wife refuses to order from there again. And I have no problem with that.,,,,
We had a fabulous experience bringing friends from out of town who were thoroughly impressed with the food wine and service. From the escargot and salads to the duck confit and chicken confit it was a wonderful experience.,Service,,,
Simple menu. Cash only. Chili was particularly tasty. The Swiss burgers were quite good.,,,,
Very good. Had the Shawarma platter. Everything was very tasty the meat rice potatoes etc. I do go there every once in a while for takeout. The owner is friendly. I believe the name has changed recently.,Service,,,
Oh Ichiza how we missed your extensive and affordable menu and how we missed your honey toast. Such a simple item that we thought would be easily found in California or even replicated at home but we were wrong. \n\nRaku may have the new title as the best Japanese restaurant in Vegas but you are still one of the top izakayas around and your extensive hours make you a winner. \n\nOh and you even accept Amex. So cool.,,,,
Service was very friendly and accommodating. They did forget a few drinks but with a table of 20 it could have just been a backup in the bar? I was here with a very large group and everything was wonderful even my custom dish!,Service,,,
The service was superb and the mango salad was to die for! Prices are not super cheap as we didnt choose the dinner special but the price for pad thai was the same as everywhere else. Will definitely go back there again!,Service,,Value,
My favorite Mexican Restaurant near downtown Phoenix. Neighborhood just adds to the flavor of this place. I just wish I loved closer so I could eat here more and have access to the freshly made tortillas.,,,,Location
Here is where I want to come every week. I highly recommend this seafood store. Exceeding expectations I want use more photos to explain.,Service,,,
Solid food. Great for take out as they are very fast. Kind of expensive but good quality. Try the pork or chicken streamed dumplings.,Service,,Value,
What can I say this place is nothing but great service and great food. Happy hour is the best. Always a stop while in Las Vegas!!,Service,,,
"Impressive. Why? Because Ramona was our waitress! \n\nAlso ""chicken schnitzel"" which would be Much Better as ""Chicken Marsala"" was on the menu: Ramona please consider; just put a little Marsala wine in the poutain gravy saut\xc3\xa9ed some mushrooms and you have a Great Dish rather than the dry schnitzel dish!!!",Service,,,
"First disappointing visit. Stopped in at 4PM Sun during the Masters golf tourney to get their popular ""fav pepperoni""..They were out!? Wow. Headed to Pizza Hut frowning",,,,
Food and staff are normally great but Cinco de Mayo clearly caught them by surprise. 25 min wait for table which is fine but waiting another 50+ min in addition for food with 3 children on tow. Sure hope they can get it together.,Service,,,
I normally order online using their phone app as when you sign-up for rewards you get some really great deals. I rarely pay more than $8 for a large pizza and one time I paid $11 for an XL. They always have my pizza ready on arrival and show me the pie for handing it to me.\n\nI normally only come here if the price is cheaper than Pizza Hut though.,Service,,Value,
Fresh ingredients friendly staff and phenomenal taste!!! I enjoyed a small cheese pizza during their lunch special for only $4.10! HIGHLY recommend!!!,Service,,Value,
I would not recommend this place. The food is decent but the staff and service are awful. They will always mess up your order you can be sure of that.,Service,,,
Subpar and Bland cupcakes. Much better can be had within 2 miles of this place. Keep looking. $3.75 or a single cupcake!?!? LOL\n\nTry The Coffee Shop or Designer Cakes,,,Value,
Slowest drive thru ever! I hardly come to this location but when i do makes u irritated because of how slow they are. But at least the staff are friendly:),Service,,,
For some reason I got a better burrito at the Lakeshore (Stevebak) location then at Dundas. Good food and can be made very spicey!,,,,
Went for lunch and got a small Greek salad. There was more onions and tomato than lettuce. The facility is across the street from greyhound bus station so you will get approached by the homeless.,Service,,,Location
Great food and service. Small casual setting. Great for families. No liquor license.,Service,Ambience,,
I don\'t always drink coffee but when I do I prefer Not Just Coffee\n\nThe caramel latte here is a must try. Well balanced flavors and it\'s not overly sweet. It\'s just the perfect latte made with love by the great baristas behind the bar. I have only high praise for this establishment. The service is great and the coffee is nothing less than amazing. This is coffee done right!,Service,,,
This place was so delicious!! I had tofu tacos and they were absolutely delicious. We were in Noda for a concert across the street and we were so happy to find this restaurant for dinner before the show. Highly recommend for authentic latino food!,,,,Location
We loved this place so much we went twice while we were visiting Toronto. The pizza was amazing and the atmosphere on a Saturday night was very fun. The music was nice and we were dancing throughout dinner,,Ambience,,
I came with about 12 of my coworkers. We were seated right away! Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the variety of food stationed offered. From Asian to BBQ Italian a great salad bar and dessert bar etc. The food was fresh hot and very tasty. I will definitely be coming back in the near future! :),Service,,,
I loved the entrance. We were a large party of 15 people. We ate family style ordering and sharing appetizers and meals. The singer was doing his thing. We were all having a good time and unwinding. It reminded me of a family meal as we were loud and laughing a lot.,,Ambience,,
We decided to order two fish tacos and a veggie burrito today. The veggie burrito is always amazing but I was very dissatisfied with the fish tacos since one of them was only filled half of the way. Despite the fact that they were still amazing it is unfortunate that you pay for a product only to receive half of it. This is not the first time this has happened to me nor the first item that has happened to me with.,Service,,,
Five stars for the Grandma Pizza.\nThe service is friendly and efficient. Other menu items that I have had (and I have had many of them) are very good.\nGreat neighborhood place that has only gotten better with age. I believe Louie and family are here for the long haul.,Service,,,
"Port Credit/Lakeview is in desperate need of a good sushi place and the truth is that none exists. Alarm bells should always go off when you see Escolar fish served... or as they call it ""white tuna"". Do some research and you will be grossed out quickly. This... a Japanese restaurant serving a fish banned in Japan. \n\nAnyway. ""Ok"" sushi can be found here. Uninspired but hey at least it\'s something.",Service,,,
Nice and quiet place to have burgers with friends and family. Also there are some very nice window view seats. The owner and staffs are super friendly and have nice smile. They offer to bring over our combos instead of calling us over.,Service,Ambience,,
"Had lunch sesame chicken & fried rice. Portion was large but tasteless. Owner was attentive and friendly. Open kitchen and tables by window. Counter service was reasonably quick. The food was better at their old location on Guadeloupe/McClintock. New cook perhaps? It now occupies the old ""Chopstix"" location at the Albertson\'s shopping center. Try China King a few blocks away.",Service,,,
I had the fire burrito. It was a good size burrito and the spicy sauce is yummy but the ground beef was not seasoned and very bland. My colleague for the tacos and stated he shredded beef was also bland.,,,,
If they want people to come there then should be nicer because I was there with my husband and the lady working there was giving me a dirty look and instead of handing me the receipt nicely she just threw it on the counter I think me and my husband will not go there again.,Service,,,
Purchased a Groupon based on the menu online linked to the site. Sat down and noticed some dishes were up to $5 more than the online menu and they would not honor the price. She was rude and would not help us in any way. We walked out.,Service,,Value,
This place is amazing! Best tacos EVER! The fish tacos are my favorite but honestly everything here is so good! This is a MUST-TRY in Toronto !,,,,
I loved everything about this place! The service was outstanding the atmosphere was relaxing and the food was very tasty!\n\nI ordered the chorizo eggs benedict with a mocha latte. Perfection.,Service,Ambience,,
It took over half hour to get a salad and a sandwich order. With kids wanting their sticky bun orders it was not a relaxing night out.,Service,,,
Stopped by for cheesecake on a Sunday afternoon - Website & hours on door said they were open - door was locked & nobody was inside. They should have been open for another 2 hours. So disappointed! Might be a good idea to call first!,Service,,,

Great Chicken tacos and the retried beans are the kind! Great prices at lunch! Pleasantly surprised!!,,Ambience,,
Authentic quick Mexican food. Very clean and great salsa bar. Some other places skimp on the guacamole on the rolled tacos but they serve just the right amount. Beans are awesome too!,Service,Ambience,,
Im sure they have great pizza. It looked and smelled great. Alas i will never know. After waiting for 10 mins to even be acknowledged my pleasant yet servertorially challenged counter person informed me only pizza. No sandwiches pasta etc. lost opportunity for a Monday night. He spent more time wiping the front of the oven down than being concerned with taking an order. Booooio!,Service,,,
Great home-made ice-cream. You can see its good ice cream only be looking at it but the taste will convince you that you arrived to the right place. they dont have a huge selection of flavors (I would say around 10) but 1 good flavor is all you need right ? well they have around 10 of those :),,,,
Good tempura good rolls (dragon california) - a great neighborhood place with good value for money. We go a couple of times a month with the kids for a quick sushi fix. Very nice service. We also bought party platters from them and our guests loved the rolls. \nThe only issue I have is that they use far too much mayo -- almost every special roll has mayo in it.,,,Value,
This week. Skimpy toppings and unbelievable pricing. 25-35 for a large pizza if you get a cpl toppings. \nVery good tasting and flavor but add a salad and a drink and you are at 50 bucks for a pizza meal. No real entertainment value boring. Maybe one TV at he bar\n\nUnless you wanna blow 100 on a family night out for pizza... \n\nPS Bashas has a similar oven and prepare a delicious pizza for under 10.00!!. Tons of toppings pick it up piping hot save 90 for another day,,,Value,
Ricardo was an amazing help and super friendly guy. We ate Ceviche de PescadoLomo Saltado with some Yucca a la Huancaina. Absolutely fantastic and finished off lunch with Helado de Lucuma. Highly recommend and it is easy to find. I look forward to coming back in the near future:),Service,,,
Best pizza in the Uptown area hands down! Get in my belly!! They also have a summer special where you buy a pizza and get the second one half off!,,,,

Great Southern comfort food. The meatloaf is awesome! It is a great lunch spot in downtown Charlotte.,,,,
A good place for Cantonese cuisine and a casual family meal. We ordered the house super bowl congee fried Turnip patties Cantonese chow mein and seafood fried rice with dry garlic. The food came out a little too quick for us so some of the dishes were only luke warm by the time we got to them. However the flavours were on point as the seasonings were well balanced with each other. The servers were attentive and quick.,Service,,,
Excellent all the way. We were tired and had to be at a show in an hour. The wait staff was amazing. Professional and got us in and out to make our show in plenty of time without compromising a thing. Steaks were cooked to perfection. They have a burger special that is a great price and burgers were the real deal. Appetizers were also worth every penny.,Service,,Value,
If you want a $20 glass of crappy house wine with only one server/bartender for the whole restaurant - not his fault but the service was so slow I was already boarding by the time I got my check and had to run - this place is for you...,Service,,Value,

Clean awesome staff and the food is amazing. Have been three times now and will be going back. Easily the best Mexican restaurant in Rock Hill.,Service,Ambience,,
I wanted to try out a New Korean BBQ and found this restaurant. The food is very authentic and tasty and the service is excellent. Everyone was so nice and welcoming the minute you arrive till you leave. This is now one of my favorite spot. Highly recommend to all my friends and family.,Service,,,
love this location... its near where we live so we come quite often... its pretty busy and parking is sometimes a pain but i love that they still have the self pay for when im in a rush and only have a few things. they changed some lanes so i had to re learn where some items are but for the most part its very clean and i can go in and get what i need without having to figure out where everything is. never really had to deal with the staff but they are very friendly when checking out,Service,,,
Their prices have increased significantly over the years. Much too pricy for what it is. Food quality is good. Place always seems a little gross.,,Ambience,Value,

Great place for breakfast! Fresh light healthy options combined with more traditional filling choices. I went for the eggs florentine which were perfect loved the mushrooms in there. Great atmosphere calm quiet. We came with a larger group but everyone was able to find something. Very good kids menu with a variety of options. Priced just right. Our party left full and very happy! Also the four peaks French toast is AMAZING!,,Ambience,,
I have always enjoyed the Dragon restaurant. The lady up front is very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. Shrimp with Garlic sauce is my favorite.,Service,,,
Not off to a good start....went there today and they would not honor the Monday $5.00 pizza coupons Pieology emails out to their eClub members. There was 3 other people in line besides myself wanting to use our coupons and all we got was attitude! The pizza was good but there are a lot of places that serve good pizza the thing that sets great restaurants apart from the others is service and that we did not receive.,Service,,Value,
Great little place. Service was friendly and attentive. The Bacon Avocado Benedict was delicious!,Service,,,
Had been to Thai Rama with friends. I was looking for a moderately spicy dish and I liked the drunken noodles. The ambience is also pretty good\nP.S: They charge gratuity if there are more than 5 people.,,Ambience,,
Charming restaurant in an old converted house. Great food & service too! Would highly recommend and come back.,Service,Ambience,,
Maria was terrific! We were in a time crunch and she got our lunch out to us quickly. The food was great. The crunchy French toast is our favorite and their coffee is outstanding!,Service,,,
This is my favorite brewery outside Asheville. Great people running the place average entertainment but the beer is phenomenal. Jalape\xc3\xb1o pale ale is the bomb! Seasonal rotations are pretty good too.,Service,,,
Healthy when you skip the rice (carbs). Feel bad they are not busier.,,,,
Great staff! Great food! Comfortable environment! You should try the homemade pancakes! They are delicious! My husband had the protein omelet and he liked that too,Service,Ambience,,
It was okay. My mom had ordered the bulgogi tang and it was way too sweet. Literally sweetened meat soup. The soon tofu was okay but honestly I prefer Tofu Village down the road.,,,,
Lives up to its name. Food is well prepared and the service is amazing. I ordered the farm burger which was delicious and truffle fries. I found some interesting things about this place. The menu has a cool design of gordon ramsay also they bring you an ipad to look over drinks and desserts and at the end a little survey on an ipod\n\nThe reason i am giving 4 stars is that the burgers are great but not the best i tried. Lacking a custom build burger menu in my opinion.,Service,,,
My favorite bean in the Burgh! I have had many a cup of coffee hear and none of them bad. They roast much of their own beans and have an ample selection. Well worth trying.,,,,
I have waited a long time to write this review. I was here in February of 2016. I remember having very good service from the guy I spoke to through the drive through however a few hours after eating I had a terrible case of food poisoning. It was not fun at all I understand that this was probably a rare occurrence due to an undercooked batch of chicken however I will not be returning. I have never had food poisoning before so I am traumatized from this experience.,Service,,,
Great food great drink. I had the crab enchiladas (very good) and a Margarita Flight (1 Patron 1 Passion Fruit and 1 I do not remember). This place never disappoints.,,,,
Very good HUGE slices kind and hardworking owner. A monthly Friday night staple in my house.,Service,,,
Friendly staff delicious food. Amazing brunch! They even have several gluten free options.,Service,,,
"Had the ""real deal"" it\'s better then the ""supreme"" from pizza hut. Keep up the good work guys.",,,,
Excited to try more of their menu. I have had takeout from here one time for lunch and it was great. Chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The chicken was juicy and the green sauce was spicy and flavorful. They are listed as Latin American but they have your usual favorites you can find at Mexican joints as well.,,,,
The breakfast burrito was great. Tasted fresh and had a ton of flavor. The salsa could be improved a little bit but overall it was great and I will be back.,,,,
I had a surprisingly poor meal here just after Christmas 2013. I ordered vegetable curry as my main course. The vegetables were soggy & pedestrian & seemed to have come out of a package frozen. The sauce was generic as though supermarket curry powder had simply been stirred into tomato sauce.\n\nThe samosas were OK but not very flavourful.\n\nI wondered if the ownership &/or chef had changed since the last time I had eaten here several years ago when the food had been first-rate.,Service,,,
Easily the best tasting and priced food and drinks in Chandler. I got the combo meat sandwich with Mac and cheese and one of the moonshine drinks and walked away wanting only for more of their food despite me being full and happy :),,,Value,
Over priced FOOD! Ordered the lobster and crab stuffed mushrooms for 13.95 ... And not worth it you only get four and they tasteless and microwaved so definitely not fresh!,,,Value,

I went there with my wife and baby and I did not know that they had live music that day but it was way too loud so we ordered and took the food to go. We got home and started eating it it was so salty and burnt. We tried to eat as much as we could but it was just terrible so we had to throw it away because it really was not edible. I felt really bad because I dont like wasting food or money(we spent about $30) Needless to say we will never go back there,,Ambience,,
Great pasta at a reasonable price. On 17th ave but has parking in the back which is nice. Atmosphere is casual and not uptight.,,Ambience,,

The Canadiana iced latte is incredible!! Highly recommend. It is a little small in there but always busy and cute vibe,,Ambience,,
We love this place! Ask for the stamp card! 10th frozen yogurt is free. The best flavor combo by far is mango and salted caramel. Trust me!,,,Value,
Not sure where all the 3+ star reviews are coming from on this one. Tired Mexican place in Scottsdale with very mediocre food.\n\nWe had a cheese crisp with chicken and a mexican salad. Both were bland and you could easily make better Mexican food at home!\n\nit was also weird that they serve their salsa in carafes and you have to pour it on a plate and try to scoop it up with their stale chips. Have you ever heard of bowls people??,Service,,,
Very good hella kitchen burger and the fries with egg and salami!\n\nThe line went fast,,,,
"I had the red curry for lunch and it was delicious! I wanted it Thai hot and boy did they knock my boots off with the spiciness level! They know exactly what ""Thai Spicy"" means not like other wanna be Thai restaurants that don\'t know how to bring the heat!\n\nI\'m happy to finally find a place with delicious Thai food at an affordable price. I can\'t wait to get my next dose of spice from them!",,,Value,

Not the very best service bad products. The bagel I got was not soft you could tell it was frozen. I ask for ginger ale and they said they were out when it was barely 7am. How could they be out already. SMH....,Service,,,
Love this restaurant. Meat selections were very fresh and good variety. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. We had a birthday cake and they made a suggestion to keep it in their fridge before we could even ask. I like how they assisted with the cooking and that dessert! Ooooo weee! Some kinda ice cream sandwiches with wafers! Nom nom,Service,,,

So many breweries so little time. Big open space friendly and efficient staff. When trying a new place I always go for the flight to maximize exposure. Found several that I liked. Got progressively busier the longer we were there and great vibe.,Service,Ambience,,
Worth the walk for a good cup of coffee. Small place with everything you need except the pretentious. The brewed coffee is worth going back for. Sitting inside in a variety of spots and a few benches outside to enjoy the nice weather. Just steps off of King West.,,Ambience,,
Stopped in for a burrito and Horchata. The Senor burrito was huge! Enough for lunch and dinner or can easily feed two people.,,,,
Feel like that I found a little secret Caff\xc3\xa8 in a cozy residential area. Nice coffee interior and reasonable price. High sealing as well! ;),,Ambience,Value,Location
Overall the service and vegan food is good but not my favorite. The atmosphere is loud and the chairs are not that comfortable.,,Ambience,,
Went here for the first time for lunch a couple days ago modern ambiance friendly and helpful staff DELICIOUS Bang bang shrimp but average burgers and fries. criapy calamari was sort of plain.,Service,Ambience,,
Was looking for a great brunch spot to surprised my boyfriend with for his birthday and came across RS online. Glad I did because the food was absolutely delicious! Each dish was packed with flavour and the presentation was impeccable. Not to mention all of the staff were wonderful as well. Would come back again in a heartbeat!,Service,,,
This was our first time coming here and wow the Pizza we had was so delicious. Our waitress Amber made some great drink recommendations and was very nice and outgoing.\nWe absolutely loved it. We will be back for sure.,Service,,,
Service was excellent. In an awkward location in the lobby. Went with a couple of friends. My steak was alright the burger my buddy had was supposedly good. I definitely would recommend this restaurant and definitely come back here.,Service,,,Location
We walked in at 7:30pm and ordered a salad and a large pizza and same with our friends and we did not get our pizza until 8:45pm! The service was unacceptable and did I mention that there were only 3 couples in the restaurant!!! Never again will we be going to the restaurant! Poor service!,Service,,,
"What a great find! We stumbled upon this place and had an excellent dinner. The margarita was tasty and the food was great. The guacamole was just ok but the Bandera Mexicana entre I had was delicious. It was three different enchiladas all super spicy and yummy. My son had a custom burrito (they were very nice to do this) and he said it was ""perfectly balanced"" between the ingredients. A huge win for us. All good super nice staff too!",Service,,,
Great Mexican food....super friendly staff especially Ivan out server! Margherita was Great too!!!,Service,,,
Everything about this store is ok nothing is bad. The 5$ box + a soda is enough to get you full. Alright freshness and taste. You will not be disappointed but at the same time will not be awed :),Service,Ambience,Value,
This was my first time visiting this venue I was actually very impressed by the quality of food and service. Im very active in the restaurant business and am normally quite picky about my experiences. I would definitely come back here.,Service,,,

Good bagels. Amazing cream cheese. Quick and in a great location customer service is bland.,Service,,,
I eat there and take out often and the authentic Mexican food is as good as it gets...\nVery easy on the wallet too!,,,Value,
Id give the place 4.5 if I could but cant... \nBut overall experience was good co worker recommended this place to me and im glad I tried it. 4.5 coz of the cashier... shes a bit snobby and hmmmmm? I dont know how to describe her service. The burger itself is Pretty great! I ordered the Tamago and the Original the tamago was very tasty compared to the Original being a basic tasting burger. The price is a bit much though for a burger $8+...,Service,,Value,
We just do the last minute dinner search and this one sure come with a surprise! Price is set at excellent mark and fish and food is fresh. Sure will come again !,,,Value,
So excited to add a new restaurant to our favorites in Las Vegas. Carbone is tucked away upstairs in ARIA and well worth the visit. The complimentary starters are divine with a bountiful bread basket. We listened to the Maitre D and shared the Caesar salad Meatballs spicy rigatoni and Veal Parmigiana. Everyone left stuffed yet wanting more.\nGreat new addition to Las Vegas,,Ambience,,
I loved this place!! One of the best sushi places in Calgary now!! They have Super fresh salmon & tuna! All rolls we had were delicious!! And the miso soup was excellent! The service was very good as well!! My favourite thing was that They have uni! Which is not easy to find in Calgary! The prices were not inexpensive but not terrible pricey ... I would say you pay for what you get... I would definitely go back there!!,Service,,Value,
We are from a state that sadly does not have one so we always stop when we find it. We have been to four different locations and this one was my favorite! No wait for a table and the service was amazing! Thank you:),Service,,,
This was my first experience with Hawaiian food and I was very satisfied! I enjoyed the food and service.,Service,,,
There was a point in time that I ate here so often they would know my order as soon as I walked in. Great pho great service reasonable priced. Love Chi Lan!,Service,,Value,
My wife and I love the food here. The place is old a bit run down looking and I guess that is another reason we like it so much. It feels just so authentic. We split the fajitas often and I really like the tacos cheese enchiladas guacamole and nearly everything else we have had. The cheese crisp with guacamole on the side is crazy good. Nothing like great tortillas to make everything taste good.,,,,
Just moved here from Texas recently and stopped by Ghost Ranch since its near my home and work office. This place is really great and authentic. I had the pork tacos which were amazing and ended up being a really good amount of food. I highly recommend and I will be back.,,,,
I have been eating at Outback Steakhouse for years and I loved the Butter churned dipping sauce they served with the crab legs & the Amazing churned hot fudge but I ate there tonight and they served me melted butter like oil and acted like it was normal like I was crazy for thinking it used to be different. They can at least admit they ruined it to save money. Disappointed,Service,,Value,
Well to start off my 5 yr old grandson \nIs a picky eater! \nHe loved the burger AND fries! \nPerfect size he ate the whole thing :) \nAs for the rest of us we were pleased with all the fresh ingredients house made sauces tomato jam yum and killer BBQ sauce. \nBurger patties cooked to perfection! \nMost important thing to me that can make or break a good burger is a stale BUN! \nTheir buns where fresh so soft throughout \nAnd toasty on the inner\nWish they had a Wahlburgers in Washington.,,,,
Good burrito w fresh ingredients. Nice and spicy good service!,Service,,,
This place was very clean and had friendly staff.. The food was good my BF and I ordered Thai egg rolls calamari and Thai fried rice.. And we liked it that it closed half an hour later during their lunch hours compared to most places that closed at 2:30.. We will definitely come back here..,Service,Ambience,,
"Staff got my order wrong but no big deal figured I would just exchange it. Lady who took it back grimaced and told another staff member to make another one saying ""he ordered sausage instead of ham"" in a tone that implied it was my fault somehow. \n\nNo need to get defensive with your customers I wasn\'t angry or anything.\n\nThere are a few power outlets scattered around but they should really put some under the long counter tables like some other locations.",Service,Ambience,,
Waited in the drive thru for about 15 minutes just to have them tell me they were all out of my drink when I got to the window. Poor slow service and in a terrible neighborhood. Not going back to that one again!,Service,,,Location
Definitely a good grocery store to find out of the way items. Not your traditional grocer but well worth a visit.,,,,
A quaint and excellent pizza restaurant. The appetizers were awesome. The pizza was fantastic. For a city that I could have eaten lunch anywhere this place was great. Mix your pizza; half and half. You will not be disappointed.,,,,
Very nice wood fired pizza. Quick and friendly service. Whilst waiting a unsatisfied and rude customer was kicking off about her (pick up) pizza being too small. The menu clearly states 12inches which is a normal size for a pizza but it was efficiently dealt with by giving her money back. \nI personally am glad to have found this place and will definitely come back!,Service,,,
"I love happy bagel bagel sandwiches but I hate the inconsistency in pricing. Sometimes ""the bagel sandwich combo"" includes the price of veggies and coffee and sometimes it doesn\'t. Every time I go I get charged differently. Not worth it to spend $12 on a bagel sandwich and coffee... even if I love fresh bagels.",,,Value,
Really enjoyed this place we stumbled upon. Loved the ambience food and friendly service. Delicious salads and pasta. Good for the price.,Service,Ambience,,

"We were given plethora of complimentary foods which was tasty unexpected and a little too oily. The main courses were amazing our ""captain"" was superb however the help in the white uniforms specifically the nice lady was over bearing at wanting to remove before we were done eating. My suggestion is for management to ask them to slow down. Otherwise don\'t change a thing.",Service,,,
My cocktail was fabulous but the sushi was sub par. There was A BONE in my salmon tartare which if we are honest was 2/3 hard as rocks avocado and only 1/3 salmon. I ordered a Thomas Street roll and again there was very little fish and tons of unripe avocado. I would have rather had the totally meh sushi at Harris Teeter across the street for 1/4 the price.,,,Value,
This is my new favorite fast food Mexican restaurant. Tried carne asada quesadilla and machaca all great. Hot salsa is great with a little kick. Mild is ok but a little watery for my taste. This is a must try!,,,,
Ive always had a really good experience with PH on flamingo  this time Amanda answered the phone and instead of rushing through she took time to ask me how I was doing  I know its small but it means a lot. I also know that the majority of the calls are delivery and you have to be quick but it was a pleasant surprise. Thanks Amanda!,,,,
Oh Teavana how you satisfy my craving for all tea flavors alike. How dare you tempt me with iced or hot teas! You overwhelm my aromatic senses with your deliciousness. I am addicted to this place! Whether hot or cold me and tea are the best of friends. :),,,,
Definitely nothing special. Many many other choices for Vietnamese dinning available and all with better flavor and much more authentic. The food was fine but there was just nothing to bring me back. The owners quirky interaction with the customers was charming at first but off-putting by the time we left.,Service,,,
I moved to the Phoenix area a month ago. Tonight was the second night I ordered pizza and appetizers for delivery. The first night it took an hour and fifteen minutes to receive my order. The food was good and everyone has a bad night every once in a while. Tonight it took an hour and forty minutes to get my order. AND EVERYTHING WAS COLD! My pizza looked terrible too like it was tossed around. Time to try some place else.,Service,,,
The food is fresh delicious and plentiful! I like that you get to chose 4 sides/toppings with a gyro plate. We can share one plate (sometimes adding a side of fries) between two people and leave happy.,,,,
Pixy Cakes is such a great bakery! We have used them many times in the past. Their cakes always taste good and look amazing! They are very professional and even accommodated my last minute orders. I would certainly recommend them! :-),Service,,,
"Eh okay. It\'s Subway dependably the same. I like Subway but this one skimps on the ingredients. Always has in the 7 years I\'ve lived here. I don\'t like having to stand there going ""more"" ""more"" ""a little more"" with everything.? What is there a perpetual lettuce shortage??",Service,,,
Love this place! The atmosphere is truly enchanting and the wine list is magnificent. It is a cozy place for a wonderful meal or a romantic drink.,,Ambience,,
Great! A must-stop between Ohio and Minnesota.,,,,
This is an American chain restaurant which is decorated a la yesteryear in Little Italy. If you have guests over its an entertaining place to take them to visit - but beware mediocre food. If you are looking for an authentic Italian look elsewhere: lamb parmigiana is dry none of the pastas tastes the way it should and the desserts are laughable. \nTheir patio is nice on a good summer day but otherwise might forgo it altogether.,,Ambience,,
Go here often. Was there just a couple of days ago. Had family from New York here for Christmas. Spent just over $150 and everything was great as always. They loved the pizza. Thank you for your great service April decker,Service,,Value,
We had the tamale dinner ranchero steak and seasoned steak tacos. Everything was great! The tamales were very tender the rice and beans were excellent which a lot of Mexican places treat as an after thought I feel. Really great stuff. Would definitely go back if I lived here.,,,,
"We enjoyed Ritorno a lot and observed lots of returning customers. Fresh and hot homemade gnocchi and pizza excellent service bread and oil to start too.\n\nThey also have a patio and have lots of indoor decor and posters about parmesan and old Italy that you will feel stereo-typically at home in an ""Italian restaurant"".\n\nOne star off because it\'s uncomfortable to sit here during sunsets and once blinds are down the restaurant ambiance is a bit too dark.",Service,Ambience,,
Worst Espresso EVER. And my steak and egg combo was ICE cold. If I could give 0 stars I would.,Service,,,
Tried this place several times with several different flavors of ice cream. Each time I came away thinking the ice cream was average. It is pretty soft...almost a hybrid of hard pack and soft serve and melts pretty fast. I would not say it has the high cream content of higher end ice creams. Just does not have that special creamy goodness.,,,,
Nice service! Baristas are very fast and friendly. Do recommend this location! My favorite one is caramel latte w/ extra caramel :D check it out!,Service,,,
Excellent noodle soup! However the beef tended to have a lot of fat on it and was chewy (not tender) which was disappointing and unexpected based on previous reviews. The flavor of the broth and the fresh noodles however were stellar. We sat at the small bar when you walk in so we could watch them make the noodles to order which was a nice treat. Two of us got the large soup and split it which was still a lot for two people. If we return we will probably split the medium instead...,,,,
You can order Chinese food and pick it up at the drive through window. Need I say more?!\n\nReally good food we live nearby and it is now our go to Chinese food place! Love the General Tso chicken and egg rolls. Always so nice on the phone when you order. There is also a dining room but I have never eaten inside before.,Service,,,
I LOVE this place. the service is dead on and the food is soooo damn good! They just renovated the bar and it looks great. The decor and the uniforms are great - really adds to the place. I usually get the Tamele and the tacos... man my mouth is watering just writing about the food.,Service,,,
Highly recommended! Awesome place great bagels and their pastries are even better.,Service,,,
Good Indian food. I have lived in India this place is decent and I recommend it but am not at all amazed or impressed. Just pleasantly satisfied,,,,
Delicious burgers!!! We happened upon Steer and Wheel today at Helicon brewery!! The meat in all of our burgers was so good!!! Thanks for making my husband believe in food trucks!!,,,,
Updating to 5 stars. This place is great. The only chain to have coffee in Vegas. Food quality improved significantly. Not sure why I have to write more for this review to count.. I already wrote a detailed review.. Just updating my star rankings.,,,,

I can not say enough good things about greka pita. I LOVE greek good and this place is legit. From the owners to the shwarma. Please give all your money to this place because I eat here like 4 times a week.,Service,,,
Literally walked in right behind a couple and I was told by the guy still slicing meat that they would be his last customers. Although there was still 5 minutes until closes do we walked in simultaneously. Coming from the service industry it was completely unacceptable. I will never return to this location as I was refused service because some young kid wanted to leave early.,Service,,,
My husband and I came to Mesa for a convention. We wanted to eat close to our hotel which was on Main Street. Thanks to fellow yelpers we chose Mangos. We both had the special which was steak fajitas. Our food was served hot and quickly after we ordered. The customer service was outstanding. We will go back again before we leave town.,Service,,,
Love this place. There are several locations but this is the one we visit. You get seated very quickly. The staff is very attentive. I had the Beef Chimichanga and my wife had the Chicken Burrito. Comes with rice and beans. Huge portions and the price is right. I highly recommend the Tres Leches for dessert. We will be making many return trips!,Service,,,
Great place for weekday lunch. Best Pad Thai around.,,,,
This place was horrible. Food looked like it had been sitting there from the day before. Cook and waitresses where sitting there playing on their phones. Had to ask for fried rice in a Chinese buffet are you freaking kidding me. Will never go back to this place again. \n Tried to continue with no stars but would not let me (zero stars).,Service,,,
Food quality and quantity leaves much to desire. Nachos were cold uncooked and service was poor. Would not recommend.,Service,,,
Love this place. Great service and the food is fresh. A must try is the monte cristo sandwich best I ever had. Will be going back to try both dinner and breakfast selections. Bon appetite!!!,Service,,,
Sushi fever is the best in town. You know when your fish comes out chilled not warm! The tuna POKI is perfectly spicy and they are gluten friendly always great service. The best !!!,Service,,,
Awesome sandwich. We had the Bobby on our first visit. Thanksgiving on a bun! Delicious. Nice people too. Good value.,Service,,,
I found this place when i was trying to go any chinese place near by.\n\nHere sweet and sour pork is the best !!\nPeople should try sweet and sour pork !!!,,,,
One of the most memorable and delicious sandwiches ever. I had the special with truffle sauce grainy mustard hot sauce and freshly grated Parmesan. Moist and flavorful pork enhanced by condiments and textural cracklings. Honestly this is where a luncheon sandwich at less than $10 can easily best a finely honed dinner at a top restaurant with a team of well versed food professionals in the kitchen. Worth a detour!,Service,,Value,
This is a great Italian dining spot at the Wynn is open late night and has incredible people watching. I went here twice on my latest trip to Vegas-the food and people watching was that good. Their salads pizzas and pastas were all delicious. The mushroom truffle pizza is by far my most favorite try-if you love pizza and truffles/mushrooms you will not be disappointed! Great place to see all the late night characters in the casino and such in the Wynn!,,,,
I found the pizza here to be amazing. The quality is terrific. It is hard to find areally good pizza in Toronto. I tried the truffle mushroom and the double pepperoni. Moith watering. The price for the large is a bit too high as it called me almost $60 for 2 pizzas. One large one small. I will have to go only once and awhile but I absolutely think this pizza is special and worth trying. Just get the small ones.,,,Value,
food was good but not exceptional. plenty of korean bbq places with better quality meat selections. but what peeved me most was lying about a made up convention therefore they were not offering ayce option. majority of my family work in the hotel industry and whether we like it or not we tend to hear about what conventions are in town. stop lying to your customers honeypig!!!,Service,,,
Yo I think they put crack in those caramel lattes so darn good!\nI had to deduct a star because they ignore me sometimes when I get up to the counter to order. Guess my lack of hipster fashion is becoming detrimental... Great coffee though!,Service,,,
You must check this place out when your in Vegas!!! Great food. Great service. Fast fast fast.,Service,,,
Cheap Chinese food especially their lunch specials. The restaurant looks dirty I was afraid to see the restrooms. My first boss always told me to look at the restrooms and you know how the kitchen looks. I got food for lunch for me and my wife. It tasted good but we both regret it in the evening. Not going back there...\n\nGo here if you like to spend your night in the restroom!,,Ambience,Value,
"The service I received at this Jamba Juice location was poor to say the least. When I arrived I was the only one there. It took half an hour for 2 employees to make 2 energy bowls and a small smoothie. One employee asked the other employee ""how do I make this smoothie?"" On top of that when I got my energy bowls (16 oz) the yoghurt was not filled all the way to the top of the bowl.",Service,,,
Great food friendly service reasonable prices (not the desserts) at-home atmosphere. A+++,Service,Ambience,Value,
Great service less then mediocre food.\nWe went for lunch and the parking lot being empty should have been a sign. \nI had the fish tacos that were very fishy and came on flour tortillas and with lettuce when the menu stated corn tortillas and cabbage. rice and beans were fine nothing special. \nMy boyfriend ordered the shrimp fajitas and he tasted one shrimp and said I cant eat this ill get sick. The shrimp tasted old and were almost soggy. \nDO NOT recommend and will not be back.,Service,,,
When you can take home Thai food and it still taste like it just came out of the kitchen that is a 10 for me. The seasoning was perfect on the Thai basil chicken and the Garlic and Pepper beef. Staff was polite.,Service,,,
"Sign on the door says they serve breakfast till 11AM on the weekends. We get there at 10:30am and they say they are done doing breakfast!!! We ask why and they say ""breakfasts shortage"". WTF is that?!?!? Change the sign then or put up a new sign. Someone from corporate should look into this place. It felt more like they just didn\'t want to make it!",Service,,,
Delicious! Got here at 1:30 and had no wait since they close at 2pm. Super friendly staff fast service and amazing food. I had the Holy Crab! benedict with the twice fried potatoes (must have). Boyfriend had French toast with eggs and Canadian bacon. We both cleared our plates. Wish we had more days in Calgary to try more of their menu.,Service,,,

Everything was fantastic food was fresh and well prepared. Every time I eat a burrito at this place feel like my first time which is excellent!! \nHighly recommend The burrito is made with quality ingredients every time tastes fresh prepared constantly so your experience is the same every time. Burritos themselves are heavy well packed and yummy! Highly recommend.,,,,
This is my all time favorite steak house! We have been here a few times now and we definitely look forward to it every time. On top of the great food their service is always amazing. Last night we had John he was super helpful with the menu and definitely patient with me! Lol I was really indecisive last night but he helped me make some really yum choices! Definitely recommend this place for any occasion! Fair warning this place will ruin any normal steak house for you!,Service,,,
Best turkish kabab in downtown MTL. \nHowever they take only cash and recently ramped up prices. Sketchy behavior in that aspect. \n\nGood place for a takeout. \nKebab quality is actually good.,Service,,,
Bamboo Bakery saved me called in about a last minute order. I was in and out within 15 minutes with a personalized birthday cake. \n\nCake: Small sized rectangle super moist and soft delicous yellow cake with buttercream flowers on top decorated in white and pink.

Fantastic place! Great Happy Hour menu. The Ahi Poke California and Spicy Tuna rolls were all exceptional!,,,,
"We are Indian foodies and happened upon Pure Indian this PM. All we can say is outstanding! The goat vindaloo and palak paneer are fabulous! And be sure to have pistachio kulfe for dessert. Definitely the new ""best Indian"" restaurant in LV!",,,,
We got take out from here not expecting the best Chinese food in the world but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!,,,,
Two adults and a little baby in a stroller were seated very comfortably. It was lunch and we had a UFO Fried Rice and a Spicy Pork Bibambob. \n\nTotal home run! It cost $30 or so. And there are plenty of other dishes we intend to try. Definitely going back.,,,Value,
Small restaurant. Tasty Japanese curry. Karage chicken curry is a must order very filling,,,,
"The sushi is great quality. But when you enjoy AYCE sometimes some of the things you marked on your card go missing. For example the sashimi or the shrimp. If you mark 10 be prepared to ask again because sometimes these mysteriously go unserved. I get that these are the more expensive dishes but then don\'t serve them. Not great service . How dare they ""forget"" our shrimp. We are paying customers and demand to eat all we can enjoy.",Service,,Value,

I am so pleased that the owner James reached out to me regarding our experience. This speaks volumes! That type of attention and service is what keeps us going back to the places we frequent!

food was good they have the hottest salsa I have ever had at a restaurant (which still tasted awesome) their prices were reasonable as well. the service could be a little better and in this day and age charging for soda refills seems a little unreasonable to me.,Service,,Value,
Yummy!! Well worth the drive (we came from the East Valley). Clean inside and friendly staff. Big portions and super delish! We will be back.,Service,Ambience,,
Great experience and food in a very intimate charming space. Greeted by the 78-year-old owner Ennio we immediately were struck by his warmth and informality. He immediately set to open our byob Argentinian wine and we were off and running. House salad and vinegarette was delicious and made with care. Very leisurely pacing and background music lent to a romantic setting. Highly recommended!,Service,Ambience,,
4 stars because the location is a bit iffy a huge pain to get in and out of. Other than that AMAZING coffee and teas and tons of options. If your having a bad day go order from DB and the workers will turn your day around immediately. Everyone is always so friendly and smiley truly a great business.,Service,,,

"Love this place for Thai food on the strip. Lots of vegetarian options my favorite is the pad thai and also the green curry. The food can be really spicy and I would recommend not going over a ""4"" on the level of spice...they aren\'t messing around!",,,,
Horrible service. Tried calling in an order to be happy placed on hold listening to the staff chat for 5 mins. Will not order from here again!,Service,,,
Had lunch here today it was awesome! Lots of selection. Ingredients were very fresh and the staff were friendly. Apple and mango chutney is wonderful. Personally was not a fan of the green salad that came with the sandwich too much dressing would definitely ask for it on the side next time. Biggest downfall is there is limited seating. Will definitely be going back.,Service,Ambience,,
Pretty good! Little over priced but the gyro was good. Nice flavor on the lamb sauce was good used the inner parts of the lettuce so it was yellow.,,,Value,

Stumbled in here randomly bcos shopping on Queen west for too long needed a snack break. And they were doing a buy one get one free = score!

The pink velvet cake I got was ok nothing special but not bad and then raspberry New York cheese cake I got to go I had 4 days later was pretty good!,Service,,Value,
Just three words: red fish curry. It should be up in a hall of fame somewhere; behind a gold plated frame. Some say i went over three words you know what i say to those people? Stop hatin cause Thai Elephant stands tall and not just with Thai cuisine but all restaurants.,,,,
Better than Oceans or Seasons in terms of selection and cleanliness. Nicer layout more selection and produce is fresher than Oceans and Seasons I find.,,Ambience,,

Lets put it this way I wish this place was still Georgios! what does that tell ya. Ive never been so angry after eating food this pizza was so gross.

Ordered delivery to our Lakeshore condo while moving in with no idea what was in the area. Went with familiar dishes for our first Kothur experience - butter chicken and fish curry. Both exceeded expectations! Looking forward to trying more from Kothur in the future :),,,,

Delicious and authentic sushi and tempura! There was even surprise lobster. Unreal. We had the omakase menu which filled me up and is great value! Definitely coming back.,,,Value,
Had the chicken fajitas and they were absolutely terrific! I might say the best fajitas I have ever had. The chips were hot and had a great flavor and the salsa superb!

Luke and Victor are the absolute best bartenders. We come in here every Friday solely to see these two. Great food and great service every time.,Service,,,
Food was good but service was slow.

I recently called to get a cheese and meat platter delivered for a holiday party and the staff were really great. They took time answering all my questions and never made me feel stupid about not knowing much about cheese. When the delivery came the selection was amazing and the presentation was great. I would definitely go here again.,Service,,,
A solid 4. Good flavors and the veggies in the main course are very fresh. The salad with the chalkboard menu was a good size. The lettuce was maybe not the freshest on the day we were there. \nOverall the flavors were wonderful. The bread was awesome especially with the balsamic and olive oil with which it was served. My wife had the great white buffalo and it was both spicy and good flavor. \nPrice for size was appropriate. \nWe will return.,,,Value,
"Food is awesome. If only the place wasn\'t run and staffed by clueless hipster teenagers that don\'t have a clue what a restaurant should actually run like. Even the ""managers"" are insanely slow and don\'t seem to care that people will sit in the waiting area for 20-25 minutes before staff even acknowledges them. \nIt\'s a shame because the food is almost worth the wait.",Service,,,
Quaint place with cozy decor and good Israeli food. Dooby is usually around to chat with and with belly dancing some nights it makes for a good experience.,,,,
Sorry this took so long Outback. Our last visit went much better than our previous visits. The server was very attentive and the appetizers were great.

Absolute worst experience that I have ever had at a restaurant. I am not sure his name but the bartender was extremely rude and we even had to go grab our own ketchup and mustard.

"Friendly barista good coffee and cute interior. Had the flat white with soy milk which was very delicious. The cafe is quite small so if you\'re looking to do some work come early otherwise I wouldn\'t recommend coming here to take the risk of not finding a seat. It is definitely more of the ""take and go"" type of coffeeshop rather than a cafe meant for people to chill at.",Service,Ambience,,
"Awful. Staff was incredibly slow and incompetent. I had to repeat my order to the same girl 4 separate times. Teriyaki and orange chicken. Each time she just stared off into space for several seconds and then said ""what was that"". Definitely stoned. I hope? Food was average panda just a little extra soggy and cold. They couldn\'t manage to cut the teriyaki chicken so I had giant pieces to try to manage without breaking my plastic fork. Don\'t do it. Just get chick fil a or something.",Service,,,

"Somebody please tell me why QT is the best gas station/convenience store ever?\n\nThe layout is the same for every one. The bathrooms are always less gross than other convenience stores. The service is always phenom. Gas is usually relatively cheaper than other stations in the area. Plus its like a one stop shop for emergency ""got to have it now""s like snickers and chicharones and energy drinks and milk and wipies right? Hahaha!\n\nI don\'t know. My yelp told me to write a review... =D",Service,,,
We decided to have dinner here last night after the Britney concert. We had to wait about 20 minutes and were seated at the bar. The bartenders were great and attentive.

Mine was delicious and my friend really enjoyed theirs too. Seemed like the business was there to please - they decorated nicely - white table cloths and all and the service was amazing! I was very impressed with this place. Could be a cute simple date night place too. Now to work on that date.... :),Service,,,

Always great service and food. Love the bread! I had the calimari and lobster ravioli.,Service,,,

Finally a local place near my work to satisfy my cravings for Korean food. Love that make all the side dish in house so you know you are going to get some good food.,,,,
"This place serves up Jamaican soul food that\'s the most authentic in town. And by ""authentic"" I also mean that the restaurant keeps close to its Jamaican roots: the service can be slow it can take a while to get your food regardless of how busy (or slow) the place is the staff keeps the heat on even in summer and the place looks a little grungy. It\'s good eats but sometimes I wonder about the place.",Service,Ambience,,

Very good small pizza (pepperoni anchovy olives mushrooms). Also had small order of chicken wings--right amount of hot spice. Second time visiting in two months.,,,,
One of the better gyros I have had here in the valley. They provide a generous helping of meat for your hard earned dollar. However the place is so big and open that it feels empty - they could use a location half this size or maybe add some pool tables and a beer bar to draw the college crowd? It has the proximity to the 101 and ASU to become a winner!,,Ambience,,Location

No more lunch specials on weekdays. If you order entree over $8 you still get free drink. \nBig bowl of soup noodle - portion much smaller than what you would get at Congee Queen. Stir fried rice noodle with beef was good. Large portion non-greasy. Needed more salt but pretty tasty.\nRestaurant only had 3 tables of customers for lunch but food took more than 15 minutes to arrive. Overall good service but no longer good value at lunch.,Service,,Value,
Torta Mexicana and Ribeye Tacos were fantastic. I then really outdid myself with a Limon Aqua Fresca and finished with a scoop of caramel ice cream. Was very clean and staff was very friendly.\n\nWill definitely be back.,Service,,,
This place is so awesome! The staff is friendly and will help you discover different kinds of tea based on what your preferences are. The teas taste amazing!,Service,,,
Terrible. The place is always empty for a reason. Employees are rather rude. Their kabob chicken was dry and tough. Their gyro meat tasted a little gamey. With only my family and another customer their tables were still dirty. The only good thing there was the cold green hot sauce which was excellent.,Service,,,
How can you not love this place? Love the smashfries burgers and hot dogs. Our go-to place for delicious burgers!\n\n(SO much better than 5 guys.),,,,
The food is okay but my main problem is they do NOT take debit. I found this out only after I got the bill. Luckily my mom had her master card handy. They told me I could use this ATM that charged $3.50/ transaction. My attitude: No debit no business. There are other places in town with much better food and service such as Mandarin and they all take debit.,Service,,Value,

There are lots of features I liked: good location local feel down to earth staff and good selection of pastries. The savory scone was great and some other items were good- not quite fantastic.

Always a bit busy at this location but a great treat to pick up before strolling around town square,,,,Location
The service is excellent and the portions are generous but found the food very disappointing. The sauces (cheese and benedict) were too salty and tasted like chemicals rather than made from fresh ingredients. The crepes had a pastey texture and were tasteless. The bacon felt like it had been microwaved.The two little pieces of fruit on the plate were good though.\nToo many great breakfast places to enjoy to want to go back.,Service,,,
"Delicious. It\'s the most authentic Mexican food you can get on State Street. I\'ve only gotten takeout so I\'m not sure how the ""in-restaurant"" experience is but I do know the food is great. My favorite is the carnitas tacos w/beans and rice. Always satisfying.",,,,
pizza and wings were decent but there is a delivery charge and a credit card fee that tacked on an extra $10 to our total bill.,,,Value,

Worst sandwich ever. I thought I was getting a Veggie turkey bacon BLT w/. Avocado.

This place is a hidden gem inside an office building on Toronto Street. I wish I had found out about it earlier. I actually found this place through the Indie Coffee Passport. \n\nCheck out the photos for the latte they made me and how the latte art stays and you will be able to tell how much care was put into their espresso. \n\nI find so many places so careless with their lattes now and trying to hide the quality of their drinks with flavor shots. Come here for an amazing coffee or latte!,,,,

The owner was awesome! Never had a pizza with so much personality!

everything smells like fish. ..soup drinks table and so on. quality of food was worse than regular buffet. i could have better quality sushi for less money. Paid $60 for 2people we were afraid to try food... what a waste..,,,Value,
Love the area & intimate ambiance of the restaurant. The staff was very friendly and met some really great people while eating at the bar.,Service,Ambience,,
My wife and I did alot of walking while shopping at the Galleria Mall. We stopped in for a couple of beers at the bar. No one else was at the bar as it was early afternoon. Gal at the bar acted as if we were imposing on her. Typical corporate muppet attitude. Lost a future customer as a result.,Service,,,
The drive thru staff is actually friendly. Sadly most of my orders have some issue and they regularly are out of MtnDew,Service,,,
I LOVE this Italian Restaurant!!!! They use to do mystery dinner show long time ago. I really missed it! Both pizza & spaghetti is delicious. Wish the prices was a little bit cheaper.,,,Value,
best Ginger location in the city\nfresh and fast good place to grab a quick bite. but no one is rushing you out the door either. \nit is not fine dining by any means very casual think fast-food vietnamese .\nlove vermicelli tofu pad thai  pho sandwiches are good coffee is yum mango shake mmm\nnot the best for any of these things but certainly great for the price and quality is consistent.,,,Value,
"Ordered a German chocolate cake after I googled ""best GC cake in Charlotte"" and QueenBee popped up. I\'ve been looking for the perfect GC for 17 years. My partner adores them but I\'ve never been 100% satisfied. After eating the cake from Queen Bee I\'ll be back yearly for this cake and return more often to try all of the other great pastries.",,,,
This is my favourite local LCBO. It is bright spacious and very well laid out. The selection is excellent and the staff are friendly. Although it is further than the Danforth location for me if I have a chance I would always shop here first.,,Ambience,,
I have found the worst Burger place.When you drive up the outside is dirty and smelly service is sad \nyou get wrong order and have to wait for one simple thing.If your that hungry go to Walgreens and get a frozen\nmicrowave meal or fixing for peanut butter and jelly sandwich.A better choice and quicker.I have never gotten a hot Burger and I only live a half block from the place.,Service,,,
Great pizza at a great price. The crust was delicious and you get what appeared to be a quarter of a pizza per order. I would highly recommend coming here if you are in the area.,,,Value,
My boyfriend and I loved Mad Mex so much that we came back within a week of stopping in the first time! I absolutely loved this place. My first order was the grande nachos and they were amazing. Their ingredients always taste fresh!\n\nYou can read more about my love affair with Mad Mex on my blog: http://kaylablogs.com/2015/07/mad-mex/,,,,
Food was delicious! I had the chicken and jalape\xc3\xb1o bacon tacos. Amazing! My kids had a burger and loved it! The restaurant is beautiful and we really enjoyed sitting outside. Service was awesome and we will definitely be back soon!,Service,,,
"The food here is okay but its definitely a classic case of ""smells better than it tastes."" It has a typical hole in the wall experience but it is just okay chicken. Perhaps I am jaded when it comes to chicken in Montreal but I wouldn\'t classify it as the best chicken place here. It is cool to see the chickens rotating over the heat but it makes for the place to be much too hot during the summer.",,,,
I think these guys do a great job. We ordered a pizza and we loved it. We will definitely come back next time we will be in Vegas,,,,
This is a solid restaurant for authentic Chinese. Their lobster pigeon and pork belly are my 3 favorite dishes! The service can be hit or miss. (Which is why they lost a star) \n\nI went there for Chinese New Year and it was PACKED! The service was slow but that was to be expected on such a busy night.,Service,,,
For the price it was the best steakhouse I have been to. The service was amazing. I love how they have so many people working to make sure you have a great experience. I had the ny strip and my wife had the filet. Both steaks were huge and very yummy. The Gallagher wedge salad was very refreshing and a good way to start the night. We look forward to eating there again.,Service,,Value,
Friendly staff who greeted me with big smiles upon entry and helped me pick a couple things. They offer a wide selection of Pastries (cakes pies bread scones buns etc). I tried lemon coconut square which was quite delish. I also bought a mini strawberry shortcake to try; which was just ok. \nI will return next time I am in the area. Interested in trying pies and other goodies.,Service,,,
By far the absolute BEST Benedict in the valley. This little mom and pop joint is definitely worth the stop by the food is delicious the staff is all family and so friendly you will not regret this meal decision!,Service,,,
A bao stand in a food court amazing!\nNot as good as Bhan Mi Boys but damn tasty.\n\nTry them all.,,,,
A quick visit from the east and I got to try the Mexican chocolate and pineapple with chili. I have to admit the spicy ice cream caught me off guard but muy bueno!! :),,,,
I just experienced a super rude employee late night at Jack-in-the-Box right now his name was Jonathan I asked him why it was 499 on the sign for this new combo but the receipt said 550 I told him no biggie just wanted to know why and he rolled his eyes and talk to me like I was some piece of garbage. . Jack-in-the-Box you need to fire this guy immediately he has a horrible attitude,Service,,,
Great overall experience wonderful service the steak was unbelievable that dried aged and the Butter mashed potatoes were to die for!! Yum,,,,
"I love their Honey Vanilla Latte. It has made me put honey in my coffee every morning now. haha. \n\nI used to go there all the time and now I just seem too busy. But if you are looking for a good place to get coffee that\'s not Starbucks go here! I love the urban feel to it and the ""hippiness"" of it. Cool laid back place. Don\'t forget to bring your Macbook. EVERY TIME I have been there all the customers are on their Apple Computers.",,Ambience,,
Great gyros close to my house. The fries are always fresh and the hot garlic sauce is tasty. The owner is very nice as are his employees!,Service,,,
Eat here at least 2 times a month. Great food that is fresh and priced reasonably. Owner and his brother are both very accommodating and will fix anything you ask for. \n\nBest gyro in the S Charlotte area.,,,Value,
I walked over here from the strip only to find that their prices were 10% higher than the store on the strip. On the plus side the do have a better selection of large bottles but if stock with the stores on the strip of I were you.,,,Value,
"What\'s up with the name White Squirrel? \nI don\'t know but my girlfriend spotted a little brown mouse there yesterday. \nMaybe they should re-name it the ""Brown Mouse"".\n\nAnyways....good coffee wonderful ice cream sandwiches rodent friendly environment.\n\nIf you take away the mouse I think I could really enjoy this cozy little cafe.",,,,
The chicken katsu curry has the right crispiness! You can choose the level of curry spiciness to suit your taste. Fast service too.,Service,,,
I think there might be a problem with consistency. I had an absolutely inedible meal there (tempura don) and one of my favourite bloggers also hated it. But some people I respect claim to have had delicious ramen there. \n\nI will probably not go back but I hope my meal was an exception rather than the rule.,,,,
Good good good service!!! White annihilator (spell check pls) freeze that my daughter got was so damn good. I forgot the name of mine but similar to Caramel Macchiato... but far better tasting than Starbucks!!! \n\nGreat recommendations from them and got one free!!! Thanks so much for the hook up!!! I love it!!! Will be back definitely!!!!,Service,,,
Awesome service good food nice ambience. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. My food was fresh hot and tasty.,Service,Ambience,,
We had an amazing meal made so much better by Colleen! She was dancing and making us laugh and we will be back especially to see her!,Service,,,
This place has fantastic service and great coffee (I prefer the ice cream ones...white shark is awesome). Breakfast is great too.,Service,,,
cute little lunch place - pretty quick service for being so busy,Service,,,
First time here seafood was good and the Charola Borracha was the bomb. Will definitely come back.,,,,
Stopped by to eat prior to attending a game. Good selection of beer. I had some salmon and yellowtail pieces were small but fresh. Asked what there most popular roll was she said the 3 way Reverse Cowgirl it has tempura shrimp in it. I typically only eat raw but I would have to say it was delicious. Was glad I tried it. Service was good and quick. Only gave it 4 stars due to no dumplings on the menu.,Service,,,
Guys if you are pakka hyderabadi and biryani lover this place is awesome. Give a try you will really love it.,,,,
The smoked meats were AMAZING - and great to get away from the long line of Schwartz across the street. The interior was very relaxing and made for a great meal. Did I mention the smoked meats were AMAZING? Very tender and flavorful one of my favorite meals when visiting Montreal.,,,,
Likes: The staff here is very nice and polite and one barista knows every regular by name and their drink! Even though starbucks is of course a huge chain the staff here make this location feel like a personable neighborhood coffee shop and I enjoy coming here. \n\nGripes: This location does get busy and does have limited parking,,,,Location
Great fast delivery service via skip the dishes. My salad order was delivered to perfection no complaints - i would order for delivery again.,Service,,,
"Love this place. It\'s not huge but it has a great assortment. I\'ve never had people up my ass to ""guide"" me when I\'m exploring. I bounce back and forth between here and total wine but usually this place wins.",,,,
Its In-N-Out..what else needs to be said. When someone from a state that does not have In-N-Out comes into a town that has an In-N-Out-you stop and get a burger :)\n\nNot much can be said. Same great food and quality as the other in-n-outs that I am sure you are used to. The only reason a 4 and not a 5 star is due to this location being usually very crowded due to location. The location closer to the college is usually my go to spot!,,,,
As a vegetarian with a meat eating family this is a great place to go. Fresh food and cooked/prepared perfectly. the sauces are great. the beverages are delish. My mother goes to the Park road location. I prefer elizabeth! Nonetheless this is a place you def. need to hit!,,,,
Excellent!!! Love love love the tacos!! They have ground beef at this location which I was super excited about since most only have Carne,,,,
Ordered from this place a few times through just-eat. Food is not bad but their delivery sucks. Usually late and very often cold. Ordered food yesterday and this time the driver asked for a tip after arriving half an hour late and with cold food! I prefer Hokkaido sushi on Mount Pleasant.,Service,,,
Ordered the fiery something..chicken burger. It was literally a 2bite burger. The taste was very very average. My buddy ordered a double hamburger and was happy with the quantity.\nWish they increase the size of the Chicken.. Overall ambience was nice.,,Ambience,,
D\xc3\xa9cor correct mais le menu est lamentable. Beaucoup de combos ou forfaits impos\xc3\xa9s pas vraiment une place pour les amateurs de sushis.,,,,
I order rolled tacos with just cheese and I got meat in them. I ordered a side of rice and I got French fries. Terrible service but the fries were good. I do not eat meat and my lunch was ending so the food was wasted along with my money. I am still hungry.,Service,,,
I have had both brunch and dinner and they were equally fantastic! Great vibe and tasty cocktails too :),,,,
Always great food. All you can eat is the best option for the price. Fresh and yummy. We go about once a month.,,,Value,
Buffet style hot lunch with separate sandwich line and salad bar. Prices reasonable. Food had been on warmer too long. Edible but not delectable. Nice decor but I would clean better.,,Ambience,Value,
"Closed on a Saturday at 6:13 pm when the sign clearly reads open till 8 pm on Saturday. Not even a note on the door to say ""Sorry we suck today"".",,,,
Horrible buffet since they have removed the seafood option. Very little selection now. Would not recommend!! Go somewhere else. Do not waste your time and money.,,,,
Moved from Phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place.,,,,
Had been meaning to stop in for some time after I read about this place on the Nextdoor app. Finally made it for dinner tonight with my son. We were greeted quickly and warmly by Olivia who provided excellent service throughout the meal. Ordered basic items like margarita pizza beet and goat cheese salad garlic knots and blueberry mascarpone cheesecake. Everything tasted fresh and delicious and we will be back soon.,Service,,,
Awesome place with great food. Ever since the new ownership the place has really turned around. That Detroit Style Deep Dish is great too.,Service,,,
Old school authentic setting. Huge lunch crowd - there maybe a wait. The place has lots of history and culture in Dilworth area. Filling dishes served smoking hot.,,Ambience,,
Solidly good food. Nice staff and I love the ease of online ordering.,Service,,,
"they suck order online and they don\'t even get the order right 39$ for 2 medium sized pizza\'s when ordering 2 LARGE pizzas.. i could have gotten better pizza from manh***en pizza or nap*** pizza.\n\nedit: they call a 14"" pizza a large save your money its a ripoff!",,,Value,
Great food and great service! Large menu and fast drive thru. You can also eat inside in large clean interior or get delivery. The portions are large and high quality. I will definitely come here again.,Service,,,
the owner is a crook. keep an eye on the price as he will try to scam you through your credit card by adding crazy tip. food has no taste with much of tasteless white rice. i am never coming back to this fraud restaurant.,,,Value,
Amazing sushi! Wonderful presentation and friendly waiter with a killer Stache. Highly recommend!,Service,,,
Favorite pho restaurant in Newmarket! Friendly service and great tasting food is all I need and thats exactly what you get at this restaurant! Besides the yummy pho I also love the fresh rolls with shrimp and the dumplings! Definitely give it a try!,Service,,,
Bone in ribeye was mediocre...no taste tough,,,,
Tried the Mexican Mocha iced it was really good! The guy taking our order was a little awkward but the girls making the drinks were really fast. Would definitely go back and try another flavor,Service,,,
Really liked their Okinawa soba. I am usually all for the sushi and rolls at a place like this but the noodle dish really was something else. Sushi and rolls however were just okay. The rolls may have had too much rice - it was a bit difficult to eat.,,,,
We had an awesome experience! The food and service was great! We ordered the chicken fajita and a carne enchilada and we both enjoyed our food! Margaritas were great as well and you can tell they are made in the house.,Service,,,
Glad to have them here in Surprise I dropped in for lunch on the run a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed my meal. I had the green beans with chicken it was very tasty cooked well. I loved the veggie soup !! The brown rice was rock hard so I had to send it back seemed way old and left out but the white they replaced it with was heavenly fresh fragrant amazing!,,,,
Great atmosphere but not impressed with food or staff. Duck was extremely salty and rice tasted like it was out of a microwave. Not worth the money and recommend Sonoma Grill a few hundred feet away,Service,Ambience,Value,
Turtle mocha is amazing! The staff is consistent with how they make it and always super friendly and quick!,Service,,,
"Informal Seafood themed restaurant. Crowded and loud. Go with friends not for an intimate meal. Great fish tacos fried calamari and ""Asian"" salmon tartare. Waiters push you out a bit to quickly given the prices.",Service,,Value,
Had the American Kobe burger. Not impressed. Unevenly cooked pretty dry. Lots of lettuce tomato onion but 1 pickle. Not worth $17.,,,Value,
I have never been much of a burger person but I love Gordon Ramsey so when I was in town for a work conference I knew I had to try it. The place was really busy and we were told we would have a 45 minute wait but we were seated probably within ten minutes! I had the Euro Burger. It was so juicy and flavorful! And the Parmesan truffle fries were SO good! Overall great experience and great food!,,,,
Very good food and fast delivery! I ordered something that was no longer on their menu but they still made it for me! Their hot & sour soup is the best my husband and I have ever had at any other restaraunt!!! Will definitely order from them again if we are in the area!,Service,,,
Again the food is very well prepared. Service is efficient and staff are very respectful. I felt important as it should be.,Service,,,
This place is excellent. The only mystery is why people are not lined up to get into it. The food is always fresh and service is great. Certainly one of the best sushi places in Leaside,Service,,,
This a great little italian place. The decor is stylish and the ambience is romantic. The food is excellent and house chianti is very tasty and reasonably priced.,,Ambience,Value,
Great place great service as well. Exceptional espresso served with little bit of sparkling water just like in Europe.\n\nThank you for great experience,Service,,,
Far and away the best Chinese food in the valley. The Hot and Sour soup is the bar I judge all others by. Our favorite dishes are the Mongolian Beef Spicy Garlic Chicken and the Shrimp Lo Mein. The owner will talk your ear off but that is part of the charm.,,,,
Quite good and friendly service !! 2nd time here will be returning. I also just found out that you can order online ahead of time. Save your receipt for future savings.,Service,,,
"Love it. My new favorite to go ""go to"" place. If you don\'t know what to order start with Drunken Noodles...if you like love hot order medium or hot. But for those with a cooler bite definitely order it mild. It heats up quick but I love. I also often order it with Chicken and Beef! Enjoy your welcome!!!",,,,
This is a best Filipino restaurant in Vegas. Tina put all her love to make my lunch great again. Thank you Tina .,,,,
My new favorite place! 3 smoothies & a bowl for under $20. All delicious plus great customer service. Never going back to Jamba Juice or tropical smoothie EVER!,,,Value,
Great Gyros. Meat is fresh off of the spit and not pre-packaged slices. Tsatziki is a little different heavier on the dill but still really good.,,,,
"WOW! We ordered 3 different entrees and each was superb. The food was delicious and the portions generous. The service started out poorly but improved greatly before we left. This is on our ""Must Eat Here Again"" list.",Service,,,
Food was awesome! Service was great! Little pricey though $15 for a personal pizza...\nI will definitely be back. I wanna try a happy hour one night!,,,Value,
We waited a hour + for our food I asked for a well done stake it was bloody u could see it before you cut it my moms was burned and the blooming onion was over cooked and vary salty,Service,,,
the best hamburgers in town but the lady screaming every 10 seconds is annoying please quiet!!!,Service,,,
What a cute little place for a fun dinner. They have a great bar atmosphere as well.\nWe had the meatballs and the skewers the salmon and the steak between our group of 6.\nEveryone was happy and the table was so cute..\nWe will be going back and maybe even just head to the bar sometimes for drinks.\nThe happy hour was 30% off drinks.. YAY,,Ambience,,
"Love! It\'s small and intimate and the food is delicious. This is not one of the noisy ""hip"" places with overpriced crap on the menu. This is a place for food lovers. The decor is very nice as well. \n\nEverything we tried so far is excellent. But there is one thing that\'s to die for: the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e trio!! Chocolate coconut and lemongrass. You may not think these sound so great but they are all absolutely delicious. Mmmmmmmmmmm!!!!",,Ambience,Value,
Extremely slow service. Had to repeatedly ask for more coffee. Mediocre food small portions. We had to ask for silverware. The waitress once again forgot about us. In order for us to eat our meals I had to get up and get the silverware myself. Almost forgot to mention the table was covered with crumbs in this seat-yourself restaurant. I had to clear away the crumbs with the menus.,Service,,,
Great margaritas! We used the yelp deal to get massive 44 oz frozen margaritas for only $9!,,,Value,
Loved the omakase here! The pacing was perfect food was delicious and balanced and a great value given the quality of fish and ingredients. The staff was incredible and made sure our sake was continually flowing. Well worth the trek off the LV Strip.,Service,,,
Best pancakes in Pittsburgh! Fast and friendly service a must-have if you are in the city!,Service,,,
Service here is quick and professional. I ordered a Baja burrito w/carnitas enchilado style. Cherry coke as liquid back up. Prices here are average. About $10 for my combo.\nThe food was served hot. Carnitas is lacking flavor hence the 4 stars. The burrito was loaded with carnitas. Salsa bar was stocked and clean as well as the rest of the restaurant.,Service,,Value,
Great bakery with delicious items. I recommend it every chance I get. Now the bad part is a clerk with way too much attitude I over looked it once but twice no thanks. She has made it very difficult to go back.,Service,,,
The food was great price is reasonable with a great portion. Our server is top notch I think his name was Mark. Definitely will come here again one of the best restaurant in Toronto in terms of Chinese cuisine in downtown imo.,Service,,Value,
Love sitting outdoors here in the summer. Good food. A little pricey but it may be worth it. They also make GREAT drinks.,,,Value,
MOD pizza is my new favorite place to eat. We eat there at least twice a week now. Fresh ingredients friendly staff and great pizza. You get unlimited toppings for one price! They also carry local craft beer. Our family LOVES MOD. It is definitely a great addition to our area.,Service,,,
Really really good Thai Restaurant. Delicious well portioned fresh meals. Reasonable prices. Clean facility. Friendly staff. 10/10 would go again. Try the Fried Rice and the Pho.,Service,,Value,
Fantastic variety of flavors & textures. This place is a gem! We felt like family as the staff welcomed us and told us about the history and culture of this delicious food. Coming back very soon!,,,,
My friend introduced this place to family  I believe I start loving few American dishes after eating here,,,,
Local favorite. Wife and I been coming here for years. Breakfast special is my fav!,,,,
Food was pretty good!! I loved the sauces. The service was pretty good but the restaurant was also completely empty. However at the end when we informed the waitress we were with accessresto (15% off as advertised on the site) the waitress got all pissy.,Service,,,

I have been here twice now for lunch. This is definitely my go to place for Thai in Phoenix now.\n\nIt has the best pad Thai I have had anywhere. There is only one waitress for lunch but she always keeps up. Excellent service clean nice atmosphere (inside-little unassuming strip mall outside) great food decent prices.,Service,Ambience,Value,
I went here based on the recommendations on Yelp. It was all I thought it would be. I went on a Monday night and it was at least half full. The service was great as was the food. I highly recommend Golden Thai!!,Service,,,
First time here and it did not disappoint. The owner was super nice and the pizza is amazing. Definitely worth paying the extra few bucks. Thin and crispy thin crust lots of fresh toppings and not greasy. It was totally worth the drive up there. 100% recommend this pizza joint.,Service,,,
Like another reviewer said Asian Legend is supposedly Northern Chinese cuisine but they have stuff from all over the map on their menu. The standard noodles in their beef noodle soup tasted very processed so I would definitely pay the extra $1 for hand-pulled noodles. Both the cold shredded chicken noodles and the braised eggplant were just ok. The restaurant is very nice though and service was above average. And also free parking in the back is a huge plus.,Service,,,
Ordered online on their website they take the money off my card. Arrive to a dark empty restaurant with a locked door at 8pm on a Saturday night. Got a refund easily from the third party processor but never again! Thanks Simple Greek!,,,,
This place is bad. The staff is so unfriendly and the food is mediocre. It thrives simply because if its location. Egg Works is a much better choice.,Service,,,Location
Fantastic coffee for an airport Starbucks! Appreciated it after my transatlantic flight!,,,,
Great brewery plenty of things to do outdoors. To be honest the only beers I like from this place is the hop drop n roll and jam session. Everything else was just mediocre. Not a fan of their jalape\xc3\xb1o flavored beer. Made me really nauseous.,,,,
Hands down the best bbq in Tempe but one of the longest wait at the same time. They sell out fast on good parts so people do not hesitate to come an hour early to secure their portions. Beef rib specials were amazing and just melt in your mouth. i wanna try pastrami next time if available.,,,,
Always good always reliable always friendly. A great neighborhood spot to chill out and get your lactose on.,Service,,,Location
"After living in Italy for 3+ years the ""big chain"" coffee wasn\'t cutting it. We stumbled upon this lil\' gem and what a fantastic find! The woman who waited on us was absolutely amazing and catered to our ""particular"" requests! Do not miss this place if you actually enjoy coffee!\nFantastic coffee and amazing staff!!!\nTHANK YOU!!",,,,
It was during world cup and I was taking an out of towner to the restaurant for a novel Toronto experience. It took forever (1 hour) for them to take orders and they were quite disorganized.\nI have visited there a couple of times not my best experience. Maybe it is simply because the expectation is so high as the name is big.,Service,,,
The best menudo in Vegas...Good job... The Machaca was Also delicious...The agua frescas were also delicious...,,,,
Positives: Great location; plenty of seating inside and outside\nNegatives: understaffed and/or inefficient service; long lines inside during peak times with very long wait times due to the above issue; trash cans overflowing,Service,,,Location
My first time trying Thai food and it was DELISHH!!! I tried the Drunken Thai plate the drunken noodles were to die for.,,,,
Great place for taco Tuesdays. The tacos are huge and they provide a free condiment bar with great salsas and sauces.,,,,
Incompetent rude customer service with useless and very ignorant deliverymen. Pizza is also overly salty. Do not recommend!,Service,,,
"Great food awful service! Even the manager kind of had a ""whatever"" attitude! Gonna have to go to another Cafe Rio from now on.",Service,,,
Very good - great prices - we go here at least once to twice a week to eat in or take-out very friendly staff,,,Value,
I have been stopping in the last week or so for lunch and have only had the large bowl of war won-ton soup both times but it is very good. The service is top notch the place is immaculately clean and the prices are what you would expect. The only even slight complaint I have is that they do not have fountain soda but rather plastic bottles of soda instead. But I really like this place.,Service,,Value,
Super good and cheap! Very traditional Japanese flavor reminds me the curry I had in Osaka! The green tea cheese cake is a must try!,,,Value,
Great food great service great prices. Very good menu big portions wait staff excellent at keeping your coffee topped up fast wifi and good parking. Atmosphere is very pleasant and very clean highly recommended for all occasions.,Service,Ambience,Value,
I have been coming here for years and have noticed a distinct fall in quality and smaller menu. The burger tasted like cardboard. Philly cheese steak was good enuff. Servers were all accommodating,Service,,,
Awesome quick service with delicious tacos. The spicy mayo is a must and all the sauces are delectable. The shrimp fried fish and grilled fish tacos were to die for. Awesome staff and extremely kind owner. Homemade comfortable California coast feeling! No doubt will be coming back.,Service,Ambience,,
Horrible customer service I order an Xl pepperoni pizza 10 hot wings and a 2 liter of soda. They said it will be 45 mins for the delivery it took over an hour and they forgot my soda. I called back to get my soda and the guy had a total attitude with me was very rude and not helpful AT ALL!!!!! They have horrible horrible customer service in never using them again!!!! Would not recommend anyone to this place unless you want to be treated like a piece of trash on the road!!!!,Service,,,
We randomly stopped in and a e had both breakfast and lunch items and everything was great! Very simple and clean and good service. Definitely would come back!,Service,,,
We had AYCE which was awesome!!! The presentation as well as the quality was the best.Lots of choices and a great and comfortable atmosphere. I almost gave them 5 stars except the service was a little slow.Sushi Wa is my new go to place for Sushi.,Service,Ambience,,
Regular retail price $6. Paid $2. Got a coupon from their email club for a free sandwich with the purchase of a drink. Went inside because using a coupon in a drive through is hard to do. I was greeted when I entered the restaurant my order was taken promptly and with a smile. The cashier knew how to properly take a coupon and my order was ready quickly and it was accurate.,Service,,,
The food is good. But bring ear plugs. The music is terribly loud. If you want to have a conversation you need to go elsewhere. \n\nThe tacos are small but have good flavor. Not what anyone would consider authentic Mexican but tasty nonetheless.,,,,
The reason why I Gave stars is the fact that the food was amazing but unfortunately the service was kind of slow,Service,,,
Very delicious burger. Price is right as well. Got a burger awesome smash fries and a peroni for under $20. The same items at Gordon ramsey burgr the day before cost me triple that. This had more flavor. Definitely giver a try,,,Value,
2 menus: 1 Chinese food and 1 Vietnamese food. 2 cooks. Large menus of tasty dishes. In the heart of Chinatown. I like the pho hot pots soups sizzling plates and rice dishes. Family style servings and good service. Spacious place w/lots of other Asian restaurants nearby.,Service,,,
I always come here for dinner with my grandmother and we really enjoy it. We come enough that that staff usually remember us (good staff or we come to much). We usually grab the combination for 2 dinner and let me tell you the portions are huge! I end up taking lots home eating for a few days so price to portion is great! Staff are friendly and polite so all in all this is a good place to eat Chinese... food,Service,,,
Some FL are sketchy some are pretty swanky and remind you of a Harris Teeter or something. This is one of those. Pretty nice FL large and with lots of stuff. Granted mostly processed crap and some good for ya healthy stuff but cheaper than a lot of other options. I wish they had an automatic checkout line here. That would be awesome.,,,,
Good food inexpensive super nice people working there. Did it blow me away? Sadly no but still worth a stop,Service,,Value,
Rotana . The best food and service best welcome from the owner Mr. Lawrence . And also the best Arabian night club in town with a variety of singers and very class people \n . . . .,Service,,,
Food is always great service ect the best. Value the best. Love this Chinese restaurant. No other Chinese restaurant comes close.,Service,,,
Love this place as a pit stop on my walks with our corgi!! Ice cubes for her & caffeine for me=winning all around!,,,,
this location is awesome great location great staff and awesome options for a starbucks Always a great experience coming here even if its for the simplest item or the most complicated order this location is a master of its craft. \nalways clean never busy parking is hit or miss but excellent transit options.,,,,Location
Great tasting pizza. Service is always amazing. They could cook some of the specialty pizzas a little longer to cook the center better. Salad is made with good quality greens. We take the whole family they give the kids crayons and paper plates to color on. They cover a wall with the plates. I thought that that was a cool touch. We will be going back.,Service,,,
Love the pizza crust!!! Also tried my first cannoli and it was yummmmy! Took about 50min to get my delivery order so not to bad. Will order again.,,,,
The ID I provided to the TSA was STILL not enough to get a drink here. We would have stayed but their prices are ridiculous so we walked up to FOX. They were far busier and it is obviously for a reason. They happily accepted my ID here and we ate and drank our way through a rather long layover.\n\n\nThis place stinks even for an airport bar. Avoid at all possible costs. Only gave 1 star because I had to.,,,,
*drool* \nI saw it featured on You Gotta Eat here & rode my bike across town to try it out & it was super worth it! PB Jelly Time was like a soft sandwich from your childhood.,,,,
This location rocks. Consistently great service/coffee. This is not the closest Starbucks to my house but is officially my Starbucks. Whether I go in or order through the drive-through they give me my coffee fix. Great job!!!!,,,,Location
This place was awesome! I come to vegas very often so I go to Korean restaurant every time I come to Vegas!\nI found it from Yelp so I came.\n\nBut it was so sososo good! Interior food price and service was great!\n\nYou should check it out! It is worth it!!!,,Ambience,Value,
Gotta love Chipotle - the best of the fast-food Mexican places. Expect a line at this place no matter where you go so order ahead to skip the line.,,,,
Large portion of dish and I like the shredded cabbage-tastes light and very healthy.\nVery authentic Japanese fried chicken and steamed sticky rice.\nStaff is friendly-She knows things and greet you with a smile.,Service,,,
3rd time coming here for 35 cent wings on a Saturday and as usual they say they ran out. I tried to support this place but the bogus deals have got to stop. Sorry to the the bartenders but I hate the expensive ass craft beers & bogus wing special far too many options to drive over here to be told they ran out,,,,
This place was awesome! We ordered the chimichanga nachos wet burrito and hard tacos. Everything was super delicious.,,,,
So I had spotted this restaurant a few times and finally decided to check it out.\nWe had ordered the jumbo pancake meals mac n cheese balls brewed coffee and herb lemonade.\n\nEverything was phenomenal!,,,,
Food is good... Service can be slow. We sat down and it was at least 10-15 minutes before the waiter came over. Then we ordered an appetizer (mozzarella tasting board - very good). After we finished the app the dirty plates were not taken away despite people coming by or passing the table repeatedly until our dinner showed up. Disappointed.,Service,,,
Best BBQ in town! Definitely has some long lines so get there early. The sides are also all so delicious.,,,,
The food was so amazing and the service was also great. This hidden gem is right next to a liquor store. The Labamba taco is the best.,Service,,,
I came in just for the chili rellenos... And they are amazing... Our server Ingred was very attentive and was a just a pleasure to have... \nI will definitely be back...Especially when i can have a drink or two...,Service,,,
"This is only for their TO-GO counter.\n\nSince this is the only ""fast food"" type of dining option inside mandalay bay. I became a big fan.\n\nStrawberry cheesecake - very soft and moist\nPenne pasta - great dressing with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes\nfruit cup -great amount of fresh fruits and variety\nchicken noodle soup - just ok\n\nGood option for when you do not want to sit down and eat.",,,,
The food was good and our service from Brando was great! I would like to give 5 stars but as I entered they have a sign for happy hour for $2 draft beer. As we sat down our server stated that it only applies at the bar. This is the first for me.,Service,,,
Stopped here to get donuts service was horrible and you can get fresher donuts at the Quick Trips. Really disappointed !,Service,,,
Their foods are super pricey!!!!\nbut I have to admit that their food is good.\nTheir food on the menu is good but not sure about their BBQ....\nAnd sanity wise ..um not so sure..lol\nbut one thing I can surely say. Their menu dishes are pretty good.,,,Value,
We just had our wedding rehearsal brunch on Saturday at Mulligans. The food was amazing Jay is a very talented chef and very friendly. Laura the events manager was very nice and very helpful thru out the planning. We had a great time and everyone loved the food. Would recommend Mulligans to anyone!,Service,,,
Stopped by for lunch today. Chose the moussaka and an espresso. The moussaka was incredible! The owner Dmitri is very friendly. I will be back.,,,,
Although we showed up late for our reservation the host staff greeted us kindly and seated us immediately at a beautiful table with a view of the strip. The wait staff was equally polite and professional. We enjoyed the Contadina Italian hash and pizza carbonara each dish had a creative presentation fresh taste and Italian style. We will be here again and next time will try for dinner.,Service,,,
Overall: 3 stars. Expensive gas with a mid-size convenience store.\n\nPrices: 2 stars. Prior to the Get Go station opening this BP and the Speedway were always $0.20-$0.30/gallon over other stations. \n\nSelection: 3 stars. Mid-size convenience store.,,,Value,
If you want coffee to go this is the right spot with great blends. If you wantvto meet someone for a talk or to sot a work this is bot the smatest choice since it has around 7 tables (indoor) which tends to fill up quickly. Further more the place is very small and feels very crowded. They do have a nice terrace which I guess is amazing during the summer.\nBittom line good coffe but only reccomanded for takeout.,,,,
I only recently found out that this place is near me because id been driving all the way to litos on 47th ave and olive. I was so disappointed. The green mix Burro had zero flavor from neither the green chili or the beans (which were runny and gross) and if this burro did have any meat in it i never found it. I am so let down because it is sooo much closer. I guess thats what i get for betraying litos. Will never come back.,,,,
We had a nice family dinner here. The portions are enormous. We liked the chicken souvlaki and fried calamari. The white Greek wine was interesting too. Of course the hit of the dinner was the flaming Greek saganaki cheese. opa!,,,,
Awful. Dirty and dingy. Ice cold food. Meager portions. My husband ordered sirloin steak and got one slice of meat coldashed potatoes on a bed of wilted lettuce. I had six tiny ice cold shrimp with ice cold mashed potatoes on a bed of wilted lettuce. Filthy bathroom. Filthy carpet. No wine list. Do not go here ever !!,,,,
We went on July 31st for their special price. Great service even though they were swamped and of course it tasted great! \nSteve,Service,,,
This place is awesome!!! I love the pizza and the wings!!!!!!!! I go to Brothers all the time and have never been disappointed. The price is good. They have a lunch special and larger specials that can feed a family. I highly recommend you try this place. I love it and I know you will too. Best place for pizza on the West Side in my opinion .,,,Value,
I went here with a friend loved the food and place. What I expected from the reviews spring rolls not Vietnamese style like I prefer; actually thought and tasted like previously frozen. Experience was average but the most distressing thing was my stomach has not felt the same since. Going on one week of discomfort and my guest was actually sick the day after eating here. Sorry but this place has made me make this account on yelp. \nRating 1 star : Upset Belly.,,,,
My favorite pizza in all of Ohio. Fresh gourmet good quality food made with good quality ingredients. Highly recommend!,,,,
This place is ridiculous. We paid $7.50 for this egg salad. $37 for 2 sloppy sandwiches one drink and this salad. Never again! Definitely the worst sandwich place I ever ate. I eat out almost every day and I would rather have subways sub of the day instead of any of this overpriced food.,,,Value,
The wait was too long. I think any local such as I will agree that bachi burger is way better and way cheaper as far as fancy burgers go that is. Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience.,,,Value,
Te Aro is my favour place for coffee. I always stop here or Purple penguin for my cups of coffee and light lunch. beautiful wide open patio and kids and mother friendly.\nfood seems a bit slow and ok but I love their full body coffee.,,,,
Quality and delicious pizza!! Very good service very close to my house. I love this place!!! Definitely I will recommend to my friends!!! I love there veggie lovers pizza,Service,,,
Subs here are delicious and very reasonably priced! I love that they have a small option that is less than $5 and perfect light lunch size. I would give 5 stars no doubt but there is one problem... the staff always makes me feel so rushed and unappreciated the first time I came I walked out before ordering because the guy was such a dick :( pro tip: be nice and smile!!!!!!!!,Service,,Value,
Fast friendly service. Good pizza reasonably priced. Located at the far end of shopping center where publix is located.,Service,,Value,

"Horrible place for sushi and sashimi ...it says ""all you can eat"" basically you gonna get half of whatever you order! And if u mentioned they will cut the sushi and sashimi; literally into microscopic pieces when I mentioned to the lady she said we dont count the orders and she was RUDE ...Last time ever !",Service,,,
Ordered pizza and it was cold and a huge blob. They shifted it around so much it was almost inedible.,,,,
"i am not huge fan of thai food.. but my friend wanted to try ""thai rama"".. well it exceeded my expectation! \n\nflavor was intense!! service was not the best.. but good enough for me to come back for more.. \n\ni will write more review once i revisit the place..",Service,,,
One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Very nice atmosphere - communal cafeteria/bench seating with an open view of the kitchen. Very good cocktail and beer selection. We ordered beets and butternut squash soup as our appetizers and both were very good. Our entrees were the pork loin and hanger streak entrees again very good. We also had a delicious chocolate dessert. Everything we ordered was great and it was not as pricey as it could be for the high quality.,,Ambience,,
"Very nice and welcoming staff. Great food!\nThey have a Killer ""Espresso Spin"" --- Signature drink. Very tasty.\n\n-Krystle",Service,,,
The burgers are good. Unfortunately the wait staff spent the night chit chatting instead of waiting on us the paying customers. I can make a great burger at home and have GREAT service.\nActually the staff were not professional not anyone I would ever hire.,Service,,,
Whole Foods is WAY across town and I decided to hot this place to see what they were about. I am so glad I did! Clean new and great staff. Organic food galore! The meat selection was wonderful and they had all my vitamin supplements in stock. Will return!,,,,
Best Mac and cheese of my life! I went for the mushroom Mac n cheese and the squash Apple bacon soup! Both were delightful!,,,,
Love this place!! Food is wonderful and good portions. We always pick this restaurant when we want a nice relaxing dinner.,,,,
You get SSOOOO much for your money. Not as large a menu as some other Chinese places but they have the basics and they do them very well. Large portions fast service. Several times when I have picked up I have seen them cleaning which is really good to know! I have really liked everything i have gotten from here. No complaints yet!,,,Value,

"Incredibly long lines since it takes so long for them to complete an order. And recently they have become very pushy with upselling. \n\n""You look hungry are you SURE you don\'t want a breakfast sandwich?!"" does not make me want a breakfast sandwich. It actually makes me want to cancel my coffee order.\n\nSo do I look fat or malnourished?\n\nOverall the staff is really friendly it just seems like this location is poorly managed.",Service,,,
This place is awesome. I was visiting Charlotte in June 2012 and my brother brought us here for dinner. The food was so good that we came back for our last meal here again before flying back to CA.\n\nI would recommend the whole lamb leg or the cheese steak sandwich. Their sheesh kabab was very delicious. The owner was very accommodating to our family,,,,

I saw a full page magazine advertisement offering local couples a special price of $30.00 at The Buffet. The advertisement stated that the offer expired on March 31st and was not valid on holidays. We decided to go there for dinner on Saturday night. I attempted to purchase the $30.00 special and was told that the offer was not valid because the Friday and Saturday before Easter were considered a holiday weekend. I ended up paying $103.80 for mediocre food and service!,Service,,Value,

This location offers an online coupon for $99.99 catering special. I ordered this and when I went there to pick it up the gal at the register told me it was $129.99. 30% more than what is quoted online. I asked for the manager and the he did not honor the online price. I told them they need to update their website. I will NEVER go here again and I will not refer anyone here. If I could give a ZERO star review I would!,Service,,,
HOLY MSG... They also changed their wings... The sauce is the same but they went to lower quality wings and drums... Was my favorite spot not anymore.,,,,
***This Arco is a decent gas station in Las Vegas; they have competitive prices and their ampm has a big selection of junk food; it is also not that long of a drive if you are staying at the MGM Grand***\n\nIf you are just stopping in for a snack this Arco (like almost all of their other locations out there) has a few free parking spaces available.,,,,
"Ordered a German Chocolate cake for my wife\'s birthday from here. It was one of the best non-homemade (by myself or someone here at home) cakes that I\'ve tasted. It was obviously made by them so its still a ""homemade"" cake. Would definitely buy future cakes from them.",,,,

This is the best gelato. They have a variety of flavors. i only go here as a special treat considering the price. The presentation is nice and the seating is cozy. They do have actual food but I have never tried it although it smells amazing.,,,Value,
This is my fav place to go eat mexican when I do not want to spend too much money. Food is cheap and beer is cheap on weekdays. They serve it in an ice cold glass. So refreshing!\n\nI always get the veg tamales. SO good. Always have left overs and eat it for breakfast. Service is pretty good. Got to try the salsa verde Got a great kick to it.,Service,,Value,
Not the cheapest not the best but it was open late on a Sunday.\n\nthe Nachos were good from what I remember...\n\nThe drive though took FOREVER. I guess that might be a good sign at a Mexican food place though if you know what i mean. \n\nif it was the only place again ( I cant believe Taco Bell was closed!) I would give it another go.,,,,
Good sandwich in the airport. Had the tuna sub with all vegetables. It was made fresh.,,,,
Very small place. Seating & tables are very limited. Workers are nice and pleasant. This place is near my work so I visit here on my break time or before and after work \n\nThere was no toilet paper in the restroom. I think they should check the toilets more often,Service,,,
Came here for lunch with a girlfriend and we did the lunch all you can eat $21.95. We ordered lots of food; seaweed salad gyoza edamame miso soup 5 sushi rolls and green tea ice cream.

Located on lower Crescent Street you will find Trattoria to be homey comfortable and friendly. \n\nIt is an older restaurant but that only makes it more fun. They make you feel like family. Each dish is great. They have a shrimp dish you must try and save room for desert.\n\nTheir wine list is very nice and will not make you take out a second mortgage. \n\nYou will love this place. The locals seem to and they are very friendly.,Service,Ambience,Value,
We just moved to the area and needed to find our new favorite Indian cuisine restaurant. Well our search is done. We tried the lamb rogan josh palek paneer fish curry.

We had the chicken machaca #27. It was very good. The sides black beans and white rice were also good. Also the lemonade was a thirst buster. My wife had the sugar free lemonade and it was also good. Looking forward to going back. The Yelp discount was the ticket.,,,,
Horrible food. Egg roll was burned and tasted like old grease egg drop soup was thick and clumpy and seafood delight was over cooked and tasted fishy!!!!,,,,
Good halal food with good prices and great staff. The burgers are good too as they are prepared by hand using quality ground beef which is what I like to hear. Vegetarian options are available too but that does not apply to me. The dessert is good too like the deep fried Mars. It tastes as if I am on Mars. The Fully Loaded burger is really good for those who are burger fanatics.,Service,,Value,
Our first swing through FYP was a worthwhile investment of all time-money-appetite. We enjoyed our pizza thoroughly and will be sure to return again. Thanks FYP for bringing another great option to Stoughton!,,,,
This is a diamond in the rough! I had the mole chicken and my friend had the mole enchiladas. Both were delicious. The staff was a little stand-offish but pleasant. The complimentary salsa and chips were great. I will be back.,Service,,,
Stopped ordering here because no matter how many times you repeat the order the girl will mess it up somehow. After the third time we just gave up sent the order back and went to metro pizza instead. The food is ok for the most part.,Service,,,
This was by far my favorite breakfast in Arizona! Everything was just delightful and the wait time was actually decent for a Sunday morning! Customer service was great too. Our waitress was very patient and helpful since they have sooooo many great things to choose from.,Service,,,
Okay beers. Nice environment. Too out of the way to become a regular spot for me though.,,,,
First time there today and the food is great very tasty and if you like it hot you can get it hot and still has great taste. We are for sure coming back. Best taco burrito shop in Gilbert.,,,,
Lucky for me I work close to this place because I am addicted! 3 tacos for $7 and they are not small at least in my opinion. I had the chicken chorizo and carne asada.... I thought the chicken and chorizo was amazing! Spicy but not too spicy you will know that you are alive. I had some chips as well they were great and reminded me of the chips from Chipotle that I totally love. This place was cheap very fast and sooo good om nom nom nom.,,,Value,
"I ordered delivery from this place for the first time since I just moved into the area and it was the worst service and food wasn\'t that great. I took over 2 hours for us to get our food delivered. Called and hour later and they said the driver just left with the food and it took another hour after that to get our food. I only live 5 minutes away from this place. The mall has better ""asian"" food then this place. Will never order from again.",Service,,,
Love love this place Has all the specialities I miss from Brazil super friendly staff and amazing items,,,,
"We used to love this place when we first moved into the neighborhood 3.5 years ago. First they started making all of their pizzas thin crust. You can\'t even pay extra for their original thicker crust. Still tastes good just less pizza for your money. Kinda disappointing but not a deal breaker. Well tonight we ordered a ""large"" pizza and I swear even the circumference got smaller. Not a good value at all. Maybe times are tough and they are trying to make more money?",,,,
Soul satisfying Filipino food. Come as you are and be yourself. Longsilog. Lechon Kiwali. Bistec. Kare-kare. Rice. What else do you need besides to keep coming back.,,,,
Been coming here for years. They have at least two big tvs on CP24 to watch the news/check the weather while youre there which is nice. Big portions for what you pay for (everything seemed to be under $10) Service is really fast. My go to item is the CRISPY NOODLE dish with chicken and veg. (spelled scripy on the menu) Bubble tea and drinks also available here. Definitely worth a visit.,Service,,Value,
Awesome coffee and pastries. I never have to wait too long and the service is usually great. A fun space to catch up with a friend or get some work done. Crawling with hipsters but not in a bad way.\n\nGot 20 minutes? GET THE BURRITO. worth the wait.,Service,,,
The Clean and Bright has gone down from years past. They are capable at their jobs but it seems that the enthusiasm of the team members has gone down a notch over time. This comes from the management. If the managers do not believe the staff will not buy into it.,,,,
Today was their last day open! THEY ARE NOW CLOSED FOR GOOD :( the girl told me they MIGHT open a new location...,,,,

We have a big party they said they were ready for us and we confirmed that we would be there at the booked time. everything is slow and we didnt even get any water until we complained 2 times 30 mins in we received our water. Isnt that the first thing they should give us? Giving us all this bread to eat first and making us wait for water to shove it down later. Thirsty af man.,,,,
great for upscale cocktails and fabulous dinner. tenderloin w lobster is my personal favorite. considered pricey on pgh scale but is what to expect for all other locales. great wine list.,,,,
Ordered spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls. Requested avocado be added was charged an extra $1/roll and they removed the cucumber which I thought was odd. The wasabi and ginger portions included with my take out order were really really minimal. Spicy sauce came on the side which was unique compared to most places. Service was prompt and polite. Good to find this spot in the NE but the prices could be a bit more reasonable and the sides more generous.,,,Value,
The ambiance of this spot is next level for a Indian joint . Food is ok in taste but not extraordinary. Good for occasions but a little pricey so be prepared to take a dent.,,Ambience,Value,

Probably the best pizza i have ever had. I have eaten here now 3 or 4 times. If you are ever in vegas definitely try it. I love the pepperoni and sausage pizza. Very good service with friendly staff.,Service,,,
Very good alternative to Chipotle/Qdoba. Quality of food is good delicious taste decent portion size and competitive prices.\n\nI had a quesadilla a nice touch to prepare it like a burrito and then grill it. \n\nWill certainly visit again.,,,,
Bad service is just one of the problems at this restaurant. You may disagree but the wait staff is not very friendly as one that works in the service industry I can say this without a doubt!. The food leaves something to be desired too being tasteless is just one of the problems. It will be a cold day before I return to this establishment. One other problem I felt nickeled and dimed to death as well.,Service,,,

A really great burger place with a ton of beers. Some interesting sliders pretzel bites and great staff. Snag a chair at the bar if you can.,,,,
The bean and cheese burrito is great but the carne asada is the true winner! Put it on anything and you will be happy you did. Unless you love a full on douse of cinnamon avoid the carnitas.,,,,
My favourite neighbourhood place for dinner....great atmosphere and amazing food wood oven pizza pasta and mains are all fantastic!,,,,
The bun here is the best in town and the veggies are so fresh! The eggrolls are also delicious.,,,,
Great food ordered the 2 foot number and shared it was perfect and this location has lunch specials staff was nice the place was clean.,Service,,,
OMG so good and flavorful and reasonably priced. Great Chinese food (especially their fried dishes). My favorites are: fried shrimp eggroll (can order by the each and they are huge) fried chicken wings (perfectly crispy- 8 in an order) and beef eggplant with white rice (tender meat and very saucy). I recommend ordering delivery through Eat24; the restaurant has quick service and food arrives piping hot.,Service,,Value,

My husband and I have visited a few times over the past few years and always love the experience at Red. First I love the secretive feel to the entrance. For some reason it just feels so private and unique we love it. Once inside the place is decorated so nicely very well done. We always order the filet mignon which is absolutely wonderful! And I always get the tater tots...yumm! Great place to go to make the evening really special.,,Ambience,,
I am yet to have a bad meal here!! My husband and I eat here a couple times a month and have loved every \nMeal. The staff are exceptional and the food is fantastic.,Service,,,
"Ew.\n\nThis No Frills is surrounded by sketchy people; even the staff. They\'re a bunch of no good nicks. I was in the parking lot with my mother one time, and I saw several ""exchanges"" take place. I also saw a dead pelican, or 2 dead seagulls; I couldn\'t tell what exactly it was cuz it was too smushed up. That Jameson area is plagued by violence, but that\'s how they keep the prices low I guess. Everything is gross, don\'t get produce. There\'s also some disheveled people wearing gravy-stained shirts and winter mitts in the summer promoting their fabricated charities at the checkout. I donated once but it only increased the size of the gravy-stains.\n\nEw.",,Ambience,,Location
"It\'s a typical Starbucks here, and I love that it\'s a free standing one! They have more options for snacks and other merchandise since it\'s a free standing shop. I tried the Serious Strawberry Frappachino today and I AM IN LOVE!! It\'s perfect for summer. The staff here is pretty friendly but you may have to wait a little longer to get your drink, probably because the drive thru is always packed. This location is really clean and their ""condiment"" station is always stocked. As it stands, this is my go-to location, not just because it\'s the closest to my apartment, but because I feel comfortable and welcome here. I would have rated this a 5 star review if they had a little more inside seating, it\'s just a little crammed in here. But I love that they do offer outside seating. The parking lot is okay, just don\'t park super close to the door or you may get blocked into your spot by the drive thru! Overall 4/5",Service,,,Location

"Another Tim Hortin\'s I frequent out of convenience but unfortunately probably consistently the worst I\'ve been to. \n\nThe location itself is so awkward to get into; a very tiny parking lot east of Rogers on Weston rd not very far from the intersection which gets rather busy especially with the current ""construction situation"". This makes entry perilous at times, the parking lot itself becomes gridlocked because of the design of the drive thru, this alone makes this location super inconvenient.\n\nBut worst of all is the service here, I can\'t count the amount of times I\'ve been inconvenienced enough to further inconvenience myself by going back to complain. I\'ve received sour milk and cream here with management arguing with me that the curdled milk in my cup must be my doing somehow. Honestly Im not expecting much more then to receive what I ordered with decent service but I\'ve never met more miserable people and it seems to only gets worse.\nI\'ve heard many say to me... It\'s just a coffee shop but it doesn\'t deter me from expecting basic competence and human decency.\n\n Do yourself a favor and be sure to check your order, especially when going through the drive thru here",Service,,,Location

"After hearing about this place for a while now, I finally got the opportunity to pay this place a visit. As you can see it\'s highly touted by yelpers and ""the elites"" alike, but when a good foodie friend (a writer, who\'d be a great contributor to Yelp! *wink wink*) of mine suggested coming here I bit at the chance.\n\nI am truly happy that an establishment like this is located across the street from the infamous Toronto project, Regent Park. It\'s one block away from my old stomping grounds where I spent the first 10 years of my life and never would I have imagined voluntarily coming around here to eat, more or less get some terrific authentic and unique Thai food. My family spent most of those years working hard to try and get out of this place, and now I was back.\n\nThat\'s like going to Compton or south side Chicago to grab a bite. For better or worse (much better in my opinion), the Park is changing and gone are the days of the awful run down red bricked low rises. The gentrification process has officially begun.\n\nAlthough brand spanking new high rises are in it\'s place, the neighbourhood is still gritty and very obviously working class. So what does this have to do with the food?\n\nThe fact that this place is pulling in Yelpers and patrons who obviously don\'t live in this neck of the woods to ""da hood"" says it all. Not only are they coming here, they\'re willing to line up and wait outside where back in the day, this stretch of street was notorious for a car jacking (an incident about 10 years ago right in front of this place), gun shots and drug deals. Those days now seem long gone, and the only drug here is a bang on my palette, and at the risk of causing even greater line ups, I\'d recommend you take a shot here.",,,,Location

The wings could be a bit bigger, but they have a nice crunch and excellent flavor. Service is pretty friendly and low key for Las Vegas too.",Service,,,Location

"While walking along the Fremont Street Experience on my earlier jaunts to view the famed Fremont Street Experience Light Show years ago, I got thirsty for a nice, hot coffee. It was a cold October day. Lo and behold, this Starbucks Coffee Shop situated inside the Golden Nugget Casino Hotel in Downtown ""Old Vegas"" was the answer to my beverage thirst.\n\nOh, goodness:\nI recommend this not only for that great coffee Starbucks is known for but for the spectacular spectacle for any scenery-watching and sightseer like me is this location\'s relaxed seating on its outside patio.\n\nSeatings and tables surrounded by a wrought iron fixture surround which wraps this patio right on the Fremont Street Experience pavement. I sat and watched the light show drinking my coffee and a pastry treat! Several visits followed thereafter, when friends and family is in the city to relish the spectacle of the Light Show and this place presents a seated outdoors ""theatre experience"". \n\nThe staff service is attentive and prompt. \n\nA cozy little coffee shop with seatings inside the shop, too. \n\nBesides the coffee, I like their cheesecake, chocolate eclairs and fruit tarts all at a price between $2.95-3.95... a little on the above-average pricing. \n\nWhat, not tech-y?\nMy most recent visit was this month to meet my Mom, I have found out that one thing that this Starbucks is not up-to-date for is the absence of ""Free Wi-Fi"" unlike other locations in the U.S. \n\nNote this:\nThere are two locations of Starbucks in Golden Nugget.

Complimentary rice was moist and well-cooked. \n\nWorth to check out the place if you are in the area.

This little hidden gem is inside Comospolitan. It is on the restaurant floor down a hallway when you get upstairs. It is not labeled on the map and we learned that quickly. My boyfriends friend is in a band called Secret Pizza so we wanted to check this place out. Each slice is about $5+ so we came here for a quick and yummy lunch. This is a NY style pizzeria which is hard to find. It was yummy and we appreciated all of the cool decor. Vegas food can be pricey so give this place a try if you are looking for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the strip!,,,,Location
"Was excited about going to Hot Taco because I had enjoyed the place that was there before and wanted to check it out. The parking was a hurdle because it was a Saturday night and with all the other clubs and bars nearby the parking was scarce. Had to walk a couple blocks to get there but that was a minor thing. Got to the restaurant and joined a birthday party there that was in progress. They had eaten and warned me service was slow and the food was only ok. As it is Mexican food I felt it would be fine for me to eat there because there\'s not much I don\'t like and it\'s relatively easy to make. Service was a little slow but maybe it was because of the party, which was 22 people strong. I ordered a combo because the pricing structure made it seem like the best option. Taco are $5 each and the combo I got not only included 2 tacos for $10 but also a half quesadilla for only a dollar more. The orders were taken and food came relatively quickly, which was nice. But, the food was only so so. The tacos were dry with no sort of sauce and the meat was seasoned very sweetly, which was different but tolerable. The quesadilla did not come with sour cream or salsa as most do and was also kind of dry. After the party, I tried to leave and was hassled by the doorman because I stopped in a little side area to say goodbye to a friend. They were upset I didn\'t go out the ""right door"". So, not a horrible experience but I probably will not be back, mostly just because there are better restaurants for Mexican food and also more entertaining Latin nights.

"At first, finding this place was tricky. They used to be inside the Best Western in Marlborough and Google Maps still lists BW as their location, but they\'re actually in the Pointe Inn across the street from BW.\n\nI walked inside, and was immediately greeted by the incredibly friendly owners and staff. I\'m always apprehensive when going to an unfamiliar restaurant, because finding good vegan options - even in brand-new, supposedly ""innovative"" places in Cowtown can be difficult. Especially when the trends seem to be leaning toward wrapping bacon around everything from hamburgers, to ice cream and even jujubes, then deep-frying in duck fat. Reminds me of that episode of Full House, where Michelle is trying to earn her cooking badge in Scouts, so she makes Tuna Vanilla Ice Cream.\n\nTangent!\n\nNo fear of that here in White Elephant. The vegan options are extensive, with a whole section of the menu dedicated to veg offerings; each one unique and delicious sounding (No stir-fry with plain rice, stir-fry with fried rice and stir-fry with vermicelli here!). There were ten of us here for Maria Elena\'s birthday, so Shannon asked the owner if he would order for us. This made him ECSTATIC, and he started describing each selection with such heartfelt enthusiasm that I had to resist the urge to tip my head back and commence drooling. He let us know that 3 times a week, he imports fruits and vegetables directly from his family\'s farm in Thailand, and that they made their own tofu. \n\nWhite Elephant\'s dishes are served up family style, so the ten of us shared eight dishes (two of them vegan-friendly), and two appetizers (a veg one and meat one) starting with veggie spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce and chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce. The veggie spring rolls were not your typical thawed out fare; you could taste the skill and freshness and they tasted light, despite being right out of a deep-fryer. I also normally hate sweet plum chili sauce, but White Elephant\'s version went perfectly with the spring rolls. Everyone else loved the chicken satay and the peanut sauce, too. \n\nThe winner of the evening, despite Shannon\'s dislike for eggplant, turned out to be one of the vegan dishes: Eggplant and their homemade Tofu in a Coconut Curry sauce. I wanted to inject that sauce directly in to my veins. Their Pad Thai with Tofu was also some of the best Pad Thai I have ever had. Everything was served with generous amounts of their coma-inducing Coconut Rice. If all I had been able to eat was that maddeningly tasty, fluffy thigh insulator; I probably still would\'ve been pleased. \n\nFor dessert, I had their deep-fried bananas. I don\'t know how I still had room for them, but they were a cozy end to a scrumtralescent tummy-only trip to Thailand.\n\nIf you\'re not vegan or lactose intolerant, try their Thai Iced Tea.",Service,,,Location

I was hoping for a jalapeno marg, but it didn\'t come in the mega size, but our server was great enough to provide me with that one! \n\nIf you have a spicey need, you might want to keep going because they didn\'t have an extra hot sauce or anything beyond Cholula.",,Ambience,,Location

It takes two hours to go through the entire store, and even I, a lover of grocery shopping, do not want to be in here for two hours. Also the store seems to be designed in the opposite way of every other grocery store -- shouldn\'t all the produce be on the left side instead of the right? When I shop here I end up going backwards, which is dangerous because Joe Fresh is on the left and there is the possibility I will spend all my money on clothes instead of food.\n\n- Sometimes things are ridiculously overpriced. Generally I\'d rather go to No Frills or Price Chopper to save those extra cents.\n\nINTERESTING:\n- Usually there is a lineup for the self checkout and there are 5 or 6 cashiers sitting there with nothing to do.

Just remember to get water from somewhere if you can\'t take spicy food well.\n\nIf you do sit down, remember that this isn\'t really a place for a quiet upscale dinner. The main area is like a school cafeteria. During busy hours, you are almost guaranteed to be sitting next to a stranger, similar to Wrvst. They do have some ""normal"" seating but they are for larger groups. \n\nPros:\n-Decent value. Around $9 per dish pre-tax. At this price level, you can forget Thai Express! \n-Decent portion! Especially when you consider the price. \n-Fast service. They clearly can consistently manage even full capacity.\n-A rewards card. Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!\n-Food tastes awesome! Authentic? Maybe I\'ve never been to Thailand but Salad King is good for me! Some Thai places I\'ve tried tasted like Chinese stir fry! \n-Can choose level of spiciness. \n\nCons:\n-I can\'t think of anything else. I wished they have another location closer to me.\n\nAll pros and no cons? 5 Stars!",Service,Ambience,Value,
Everything is five stars here...from the food to their bread cart and to their service. You definitely wont be able to eat this type of fine cuisine anywhere else except at a handful of locations in the USA.\n\nIs it better than Per Se in NYC? Dunno. Both are great.,Service,,,
"I\'m a coffee addict! So I\'m always looking for a really good coffee places that have great service, great prices, and great coffee duh! Dutch bros has all that and more! First off all the employees there are SUPER friendly, talkative and helpful! They are super reasonably priced! And their coffee is beyond words delicious! My favorite now and forever drink is the ""white chocolate iced annihilator""! It\'s super flavorful! They also have a stamp card as well that\'s super awesome, It\'s very easy to get addicted to this place! They are pretty much always busy but trust me it\'s worth the wait! Good thing they are opening a new location soon enough, this place is a must go if you love and enjoy your morning/afternoon/evening cup of joe as much as I do! Great customer service everyone keep it up!",Service,,,
"Food was excellent, service was friendly and accommodating. Great for a travel pitstop when you want gourmet food and a fast pace. Wish this was where we live!",Service,,,
"This is the worst Korean grill house location. Service is mediocre. Went at 11:00pm and was told last call was at 11:05pm when they were apparently supposed to close at 12:00am. When we suggested we would order extra food, we were told we could only order if we ate everything - wtf? \n\nAnother time we went, the waiter added a tip on our bill but gave me the machine instead of showing me the charge. I only noticed because I like to look at the receipt to calculate tip. The downtown location (Yonge/bloor) is much better for service and quality!",Service,,,
"Delicious, authentic Thai. This place rivals the best. The Kao Soi is incredible, as is their pumpkin curry and the curry puff appetizer. The restaurant is cozy and also has a gorgeous outdoor garden dining area. Service is great and they are BYOB too! This is hands down my #1 favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.",Service,,,
"I went to Terroni\'s at this location, after having a good experience awhile ago at the Queen street location. The experience here was a definite disappointment.\n\nI made a reservation ahead of time for 2. When we arrived, we waited close to an hour to be seated. There were people who walked in who were seated sooner than us. When we checked in with the hostess to check in on the status, she kept reassuring us that it would be ""5 more minutes"" and that our table was being set up. When we were finally seated, the table had not been cleared or set up. \n\nOur server was was kind and apologetic despite our poor experience at the front. The pizza and pasta that we had was good, but nothing particularly memorable. \n\nThe decor is nice and the energy is loud, but certainly feels a little over-rated at this location.",Service,,,
"Thai House\nMy new iPhone is becoming a great tool for finding new places to eat. The combination of being location aware with GPS and the Yelp Application mean that I can find places to eat nearby very quickly. Last night this happened when I was leaving work and needed to get a bite to eat before heading home. So I brought up Yelp and hit Restaurants and Filtered them down to within 1 mile of my current location, having a maximum of $$ for price, and being open(a critical factor often overlooked with most online restaurant finders). the result was an Ice Cream Shop and Thai House. Being 31 I opted for Thai over Treat.\n\nThai House is located in the Sonora Village shopping center just south of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and west of the 101. Its near Rays Pizza and just north of Best Buy. The setting is straight forward diner style with tables and three booths. One nice touch is the mirrored walls on each side of the dining room making it seem three times larger and lightening everything up.\n\nI ordered the Rad Nah and some hot Green Tea. I was served in less than 5 minutes to a steaming bowl of Tofu, Broccoli, and Noodles in a delicious broth. I had asked for Medium spice and that was good but still burned my throat a bit. the dish was delicious but a bit warm. I suggest letting it sit for a few minutes, or eat with someone else and share your dishes. This will help to cool the items and give you the opportunity to connect.\n\nOverall I recommend the Thai House for a nice quick meal. They are Vegetarian Friendly and will substitute Tofu for any of the meats.",Service,Ambience,,
"This is the second favorite Wild Wings location.. I have to get my Sweet Escape fix once in awhile, so I come here just for the Sweet Escape Wings! I never ever get any other kind, I stay loyal to the best! The wings were very crunchy and tasty and flavorful and FRESH. Some wild wings location, the wings aren\'t fresh and I told the waitress that it\'s very fresh and she said ""We changed the oil"".. I would hope so.. but I was expecting her to say (We got the wings the same day) lololol.. I\'m serious. Anyway, as a franchise, I like this place and I love wings. I recommend this location!",,,,
"A satellite location to the one in LA. This place is your typical Korean BBQ joint that specializes in pork and pork by products! Hence the name ""Honey Pig."" So, if for whatever reason, you can\'t part-take in pork or pork by products, this is not the place for you. \n\nBut for the rest of us who can! Talk about a nice change of pace in terms of the ""other"" white meat! Pork at times is given such a bad name in terms of being called unhealthy, fatty, swine, and etc. It was really nice to see a place that specialized it this forgotten meat. \n\nThe meat was pretty good! All of it was nicely seasoned and a nice variety given. There was thinly sliced pork belly, marinated pork short ribs, marinated pork rib eye, and beef short ribs/kali be. The side dishes/Ban-chans\' were pretty good, with the most flavor going to the traditional kim chee and the spicy cucumber dish. And just like a traditional Korean BBQ joint, a mixed vegetable bi bim bop is made for you at the end of the meat course. ummm... goes perfectly with some So Ju!\n\nEnjoy",,,,
"I usually go to the Mi-Ne in uptown Richmond Hill. Always been satisfied with their food. \n\n\nWent to this location. Their AC was weak on a hot summer day. Food came in 40 minutes. \n\nThe sashimi was not fresh. You can tell by just looking at the color of the Salmon. Retained too much water from being frozen so once you bite into it, all you taste is this rough texture, water and that old fishy taste. \n\nThe miso was so watery, my powdered miso soup at home that I get for a dollar is even better.",Service,,,
"Terrible! If you are in the Southwest I don\'t know why we would open these terrible chains of ""authentic"" Mexican food. First, their design of ordering is not laid out well. For a first timer (I was not), simply understanding what to order is difficult. Second, employee in training was nice, but this location had 4 other people on staff & they could not handle 2 groups of 4 & me. Us customers were 1 short of taking them 2 to 1. Very poor service. My 3 tacos.... 17min. Third, food was just terrible. Perhaps I\'m spoiled by some of the best Mexican food in the world, but this was just wrong. Chips were good! If you like Baja Fresh, this may just be a bad location or a bad day, but you may want to try a different location.",Service,,,
"To me the old Diner on Clifton was a staple in my lunch diet. The new location has a good amount of space, including an outdoor patio, and the menu is more or less the same (although where, may I ask, is the Heather\'s Wrap, and why do they still only serve their ""Morning Favorites"" until 11:00 am?) I just think a diner should serve breakfast (i.e. any breakfast) all day, but I digress... \n\nSo the new place bills itself as a ""Dinebar."" That\'s right, they have a full service bar. I\'m not really sure why, but they do. I suppose if you\'re looking for some of that hair of the dog that but you last night the following morning that makes sense, but the concept seems a little forced if you ask me. Be a diner or be a bar. Don\'t be both. \n\nI have only been once since the reopening, when I ordered my old standby Grecian Chicken Pita. It was pretty much exactly what it had once been, and that\'s a good thing. Juicy chicken breast, nicely seasoned on a bed of greens with tomato and red onions, feta cheese and a delicious lemon sauce to tie the whole thing together very nicely. Unfortunately it was served with french fries though, and not particularly good ones. It used to come with their homemade chips. I didn\'t see those available anywhere on the menu. I\'d take those chips over fries any day. \n\nThe service was ""meh."" It was rather later for lunch; maybe 2:30 or so, so the waitress may have been a bit over-it by that point. I get it, but a smile still goes a long way. \n\nI\'m sure they\'re still working out some of the kinks. I\'ve read some of the poor reviews of the new place, but I think they\'ll get it together. I\'m going to give it another month or so and check-in again. The Diner on Clifton was always a great place to stop in for lunch, and I hope the Dinebar is able to return to its former glory sooner rather than later.",Service,Ambience,,
"I\'m basically a regular here at this point, primarily because of its location as I live nearby. They also have a ""loyalty"" card, which will eventually net you a free bowl of ramen on your tenth(?) visit.\n\nI don\'t like chicken, and half the menu is chicken and the other is pork, but it\'s all the same except for the meat choice, which works in my favour. The broth is not as good, rich, or deep as you\'ll find in Japan, but you\'re not going to find anything comparable anywhere in Canada anyway. Comparable to other ramen places in Calgary, it\'s about par I\'d say, which is the second reason I go here often. It\'s not ramen that\'s going to knock your socks off, but you won\'t be disappointed with the quality. Prices are pretty typical for ramen, although I think ramen should really be priced more along the lines of a bowl of pho to be honest.\n\nI\'ve tried all the flavours at this point, but my go to is the Garlic ramen, although I find the quantity of garlic they add to vary. I love garlic in my ramen, so I go for broke every time and hope for as much garlic as they\'re willing to give me, which is never enough for me. I have considered asking for extra. I also enjoy my ramen very salty for some reason, so having the added garlic really complements that.\n\nI\'d say second favourite is the Jigoku ramen, which is spicy. The miso and regular are exactly what you\'d expect. I\'ve never had any of their other dishes outside of the sides.\n\nThe only upsetting thing is that you only get half an egg (which, I guess, is standard), but also annoying because what do they do with the other half? Give me my full egg!",,,,
"Not much to write home about. \nFor about three years I had been resisting the temptation to eat at their other location for two reasons:\nFirst, many other choices for Mexican cuisine. \nSecond, across the board lukewarm comments from friends who had eaten at the Scottsdale Road location. \nSince the opening of this location (much closer to home) I earlier this evening gave in to the temptation and dined at the Pima Road location. \nAs I approached the restaurant it looked like it was closed. But as it turned out it was the dark glass on the windows. \nThe layout is not bad at all. \nSince I was dining solo I chose to eat at the bar. The lady behind the bar was very friendly and attentive. \nI was given the obligatory complimentary chips and salsa. Rather tasteless. \nI ordered the carne asada Mexican steak. The quality of the meat was, at best, average. At $23 it should have been much superior. The rice was over cooked and it looked like rice warmed over. The best item on the plate was half a cob of corn.",Service,,Value,

"Hands down BEST soft serve AND cone I\'ve ever had. I never caved in or understood the hype about this place until today. This place has been around for over a year & Not once did I care to try this place- it sounded corny & I was certain the hype would soon die down with their flavours you can get anywhere else. But I finally tried it! You get a generous serving so if you\'re hesitant it\'s a great sharing place. \n\nExcellent location, clean , efficient line & friendly staff. What\'s awesome about this place is you can have all the flavours in one cone LOL. They have four flavours - matcha, vanilla & their popular ube (taro) & black (activated charcoal & coconut). I had the popular Ube & Black twist & my boyfriend had the ube/black twist with vanilla. \n\nUbe twist was amazing! So creamy, and they truly did get the flavour right on. It\'s so surprisingly the flavour that is packed into this soft served. And the black flavour ....so so delicious. They mesh extremely well together. My boyfriend is so ""whatever"" about soft serve but he was genuinely impressed. We would skip out on the vanilla next time, nothing unique about this flavour but it\'s still good. \n\nThe cone though...is the REAL game changer. It\'s black as well, and I didn\'t expect it to taste like anything but my boyfriend and I were so pleasantly surprised by the yummy/addicting taste, no one- including us, know how to explain it. It\'s crunchy , fresh and an awesome surprise of flavour for something as simple as a cone. They also put marshmallow fluff at the bottom of each cone! \n\nPlease please try this place out!!!!",Service,Ambience,,Location
"Being Mexican, my family and I always desire ""homemade"" Mexican food, specifically a place with fresh authentic beans. Coming from southern California we have pretty high standards when it comes to Mexican food. Lindo Michoac\xc3\xa1n did not disappoint! Some of the best Mexican, if not the best Mexican food I have tried in Las Vegas!\nI made reservation for Saturday night at 7 pm. And when my family and I arrived the place was packed! As we waited for our table there was a live mariachi band for entertainment. We did not have to wait long to be seated, where our drink order was taken and chips salsa and, bean dip were placed on the table as an appetizer. Yum! Salsa was delicious and had a bit of heat and great chili flavor. The bean dip was my favorite, like I said you know a Mexican place is good if they make good beans! The chips were delicious as well and obviously homemade.\nService was friendly and prompt, even in the midst of a rush hour. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, it was a generous portion and was very delicious. The wet sauce was tomato based which was delicious, however next time I will request the diablo sauce, which is more of an enchilada type sauce. My whole family enjoyed their dinner plates and all of the food looked delicious to me. I can\'t wait to try more on the menu!",Service,Ambience,,

"There are so many reviews of other Dufflet locations, but none of this location, so I figured I\'d better write something. This Yonge and Eglinton location is quite small, but i think they all are.\n\nDufflet sells whole cakes, cupcakes, brownies, squares, cookies, mini-loaves, etc. What I like about Dufflet is that they always have a nice variety, and every time I go, there seems to be something different there. I also like that they have a small assortment of lunch-type items, such as samosas.\n\nAs a few reviewers of the Queen West location pointed out though, their baked goods are not truly ""home baked"". There are several locations and their items are sold at many other establishments as well, so the stuff is more mass-produced. It is all very good, and much of it is down-right decadent, but some times (after eating the kahlua toffee bar for example) I am left thinking ""That could have been a little tastier.""\n\nOne item though that stands out in my mind is some sort of peanut-butter whoopie pie, but I had that months ago and I haven\'t seen it latey. Maybe I just need to go more often!",,,,

"I haven\'t eaten at the P\' ville location much, but i went to the Mentor one a lot of times in the early 2000\'s. Hopefully it\'s the same folks involved. The pizza was nothing spectacular. Good enough. But the WINGS!! They were incredible. I have never had any like them since. Saucy and mild and not greasy. Now that i am a self-flagellating vegetarian, I\'ll never taste them again. I could still get the pizza. The dining room was quintessential Italian meets neighborhood bar chic. Is that chic? I also really like the logo of a cartoon smiling chef holding a pizza like a steering wheel. Maybe I can get a tat of it to show my allegiance to my old hood. They also served pasta. I grew up in a first generation Italian home and was taught never to order pasta out unless one of my uncles was the chef. The Mentor spot was reopened under a different name by a man of questionable character who i knew personally. He said ""you don\'t have to wash your hands if you use enough toilet paper"". Sorry to gross anyone out. That was very vulgar, but I couldn\'t resist throwing that bit in. I think there\'s a location down near Cuyahoga Falls.",,,,

"Had read they had one of the best burgers in Las Vegas, so decided to check them out. A rough start - no one helped me at the bar, so I went out to the hostess stand to be seated in the dining room. Nice, comfortable booths and TVs are pretty much viewable from any seat, if you want to watch sporting events. Another rough start with the server as it took five minutes to get my club soda. Those service issues aside, they make a really good burger - I had the Paris Burger, which was topped with bacon, carmelized onions and Gruyere. Their fries are also pretty good. Downside is, their ""cone"" basket of fries is an extra $7 - it doesn\'t even come with the $14 burger! So all in you can expect to drop $30 per person for burger, fries and soda. Granted it\'s on the Strip, so that\'s sort of to be expected. I\'ll probably pass on going back - just too many good burgers around, and for a lot less money.",Service,Ambience,Value,
